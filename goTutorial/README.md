## The Go programming language

Go is a systems programming language created at Google, by people with strong background on systems programming (operating systems, compilers, systems software, etc), and strong background on programming language design and implementation. It makes systems programming at large scale simple and concise as possible. Go is not uniquely restricted to systems programming, Go is also suitable for application level programming and systems administration. The Go stadard library, is a robust library that can handle a lot of features from basic to advanced. That is, network programming, database adminstration, etc.

The standard library, has more than 100 packages available. Some of them, deals with common programming tasks. Besides of being great for its standard library, Go excels for the compile time, and native concurrency capacities, based on C.A.R Hoare's ideas on programming language design and communication of sequential processes. Go designers took the best ideas from Wirth's school (ALGOL, Pascal, Modula, Oberon) and the UNIX folks to design a clean, concise and simple as posible language with great support for systems programing.
