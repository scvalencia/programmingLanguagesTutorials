# Programming Languages Tutorials

This repository includes tutorials, exercises and resources for the programming languages I know thus far. Every folder includes a subfolder named `Tutorial`, that includes folders for each programming language special topics, or particular stuff to that programming language. The included PL's are:

* C
* Go
* Java
* Pascal
* Python
* Scala
* Standard-ML

Some folders may include references and bibliography for further study, or where i've based my tutorials. This tutorials were not tough for the use of anyone besides me, if anyone finds it useful, i would be glad, but there's not guarantee for the software in this repository.
