I think there are two problems.

Firstly, what is the point in reading all of the words into a list? Why not process each word in turn and print it if it's a palindrome.

Secondly, watch out for whitespace. You have newlines at the end of each of your words!

Since you're not identifying any palindromes (due to the whitespace), you're going to attempt to remove every item from the list. While you're iterating over it!

This solution runs in well under a second and identifies lots of palindromes:
