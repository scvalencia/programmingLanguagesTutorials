preface


it s all very well  but you  and i  and most of us who are healthy in
mind and blithe of spirit  love to give rein to our fun and fancy  and
to mingle fun with our fancy and fancy with our fun

the little fairy people are the favourite children of fancy  and were
born into this serious world ages and ages ago to help brighten it  and
make it more graceful and dainty and prettily romantic than it was  they
found the folk lore people already here  grave  learned people whose
learning was all topsy turvy  for it dealt with toads  and storms  and
diseases  and what strange things would happen if you mixed them up
together  and how the devil would flee if you did something with a herb
and how the tempest would stop suddenly  as terence records  if you
sprinkled a few drops of vinegar in front of it  no doubt  since then
thousands of people have sprinkled tens of thousands of gallons of good
vinegar before advancing tempests  and although tempests pay far less
attention to the liquid than the troubled waters to a pint of oil  the
sprinklers and their descendants have gone on believing with a touching
faith  it is pretty  but not practical

but what  is  pretty and practical too  is that all of us should
sometimes let our fancy roam  and that we should laugh as well  even
over a fairy story  yet there are some serious minded persons  very
grave and very clever  who get angry if a smile so much as creeps into a
fairy tale  and if our wonder should be disturbed by anything so worldly
as a laugh  a fairy tale  they say  should be like an old folk tale
marked by sincerity and simplicity  as if humour cannot be sincere and
simple too   the true fairy story is not comic   why not  of this we may
be sure  take all the true humourless fairy stories and take
alice   and  alice  with its fun and fancy will live beside them as
long as english stories are read  loved for its fancy and its fun  and
hugged and treasured for its jokes and its laughter  the one objection
is this  the  true fairy story  appeals to all children  young and old
in all lands  equally  by translation  and jokes and fun are sometimes
difficult to translate  but that is on account of the shortcomings of
language  and it is hard to make young readers suffer by starving them
of fun  because the power of words is less absolute than the power of
fancy in its merrier mood

some people  of course  take their fairies very seriously indeed  and
we cannot blame them  for it is a very harmless and very beautiful
mental refreshment  some  indeed  not only believe firmly in fairies  in
their existence and their exploits  but believe themselves to be
actually visited by the little people  for my part  i would rather be
visited by a fairy than by a spook any day  or night  but when the
sincerity  of some of us drove the fairies out  the world was left so
blank and unimaginative  that the spooks had to be invited in  the
admixture of faith and imagination produces strange results  while it
raises us above the commonplaceness of everyday life

but  as i say  certain favoured people  mostly little girls  it is true
are regularly visited by fairies even in the broad daylight  and they
watch them at their pretty business  at their games and play  for
fairies  you may be sure  play and laugh  however much the folk lorists
may frown when we are made to laugh with them   two hundred and fifty
years ago a cornish girl declared that she had wonderful adventures with
the fairies  and she meant truly what she said  and it is only fifty
years since an educated lady wrote a sincere account of her doings with
fairies and theirs with her  in an account which was reprinted in one of
the most serious of papers  and which showed that the lady  like the
uneducated cornish girl two centuries before  was a true  fairy seer
here is a part of her story

i used to spend a great deal of my time alone in our garden  and i
think it must have been soon after my brother s death that i first saw
or perhaps recollect seeing  fairies  i happened one day to break  with
a little whip i had  the flower of a buttercup  a little while after  as
i was resting on the grass  i heard a tiny but most beautiful voice
saying   buttercup  who has broken your house   then another voice
replied   that little girl that is lying close by you   i listened in
great wonder  and looked about me  until i saw a daisy  in which stood a
little figure not larger  certainly  than one of its petals

when i was between three and four years old we removed to london  and i
pined sadly for my country home and friends  i saw none of them for a
long time  i think because i was discontented  i did not try to make
myself happy  at last i found a copy of shakespeare in my father s
study  which delighted me so much  though i don t suppose i understood
much of it  that i soon forgot we were living where i could not see a
tree or a flower  i used to take the book and my little chair  and sit
in a paved yard we had   i could see the sky there   one day  as i was
reading the  midsummer night s dream   i happened to look up  and saw
before me a patch of soft  green grass with the fairy ring upon it
whilst i was wondering how it came  my old friends appeared and acted
the whole play  i suppose to amuse me   after this they often came  and
did the same with the other plays

there  what do you say to that  do you wonder that the good folk of
blagdon  for example  still point to the hill  where the fairies come to
dance   and show you the fairy rings  like that which cedric saw  as is
recounted in this book   with the little people capering about  of
course  the country folk don t laugh at them  because it is all so
mysterious  and  as the scientific professors declare  abnormal  if not
supernormal  but do you believe for one moment  that in their joyous
dance the fairies do not laugh and joke as well as play and caper  the
bird fairy  as appears later  was always grave and loving  and didn t
laugh  but then  she  was an enchanted princess  and had sad and serious
business on hand  and was not quite sure  sanguine though she was  of
defeating the machinations of the cunning and wicked wizard  but look at
the classic grimm  at the tiny  dancing  capering tailors whose
portraits cruikshank drew so well in it  and say if there is not a peal
of laughter in every open mouth of them  and a chuckle in every limb and
joint  not  comic   mr  folk lorist  why  they are the very spirit and
personification of comedy and fun

but then your scientist comes along and tries to explain away the
fairy rings themselves  which have defied explanation since fairy rings
first came among us  once at kinning park at glasgow  and thousands of
times elsewhere  four fairy rings appeared in one night  on a
cricket ground  if you please  on which the cricketers had been
continuously playing and practising  and the poets said that they were
made by the fairies dancing under the moonlight  or  when the moon went
to bed  by the lamplight of a glow worm  that   i  think  must be the
truth  simple and sincere  each ring was a belt of grass darker and
greener than the surrounding turf  and was eight or ten inches broad
and the largest were nine and ten feet in diameter  and the others five
and six  measuring from the centre of the belt  and the circles were
accurate and the advent of them quite sudden  clearly  the fairies
must  have made them  but then a learned professor arose and lectured
about them before the british association  he was a great naturalist
and said that the rings contained a great number of toad stools  and he
brought along a chemist who analysed the fungi  and said he found in
them a lot of phosphoric acid and potash and peroxide of iron and
sulphuric acid  and a lot of things the fairies had never heard of and
certainly never brought there  and he said that that  with phosphated
alkali and magnesia  accounted for the rings  and then another great
professor said that they must have been years in coming  and that
electricity might have something to do with it  and that small rings
sometimes spread to fifty yards in diameter  which only proves the
wonderful power of happy industry of the fairies  even in their revels
and in their play

so much for the fairies

but everybody is not in love with fairies  some people don t care for
them  some  as we have seen  don t even believe in them  many don t care
to read about them  being insensible to their grace and pretty elegance
their exquisite dignity  and their ever present youth  who ever heard of
a middle aged fairy  such folk  be their age what it may  generally
prefer fun  especially do they love what charles dickens once for all
defined and established as the spirit of christmas  well  here they may
find father christmas at home  and on his rounds  here they will find
revealed and laid bare the whole secret and mystery of santa
claus  where the presents come from  and where they are stored  how they
are packed and how delivered while we are all asleep in our beds
delivered from the waits  here  too  the  old fangled father  is
justified in the eyes of his  new fangled sons   who recognise that
fundamental truths  and such truths   are not shaken by the on coming
tide of time  and here  besides  you may learn what goes on on that
other side of the moon which we never see  and what is its service to
man  and to woman and child as well  and for the first time in the
history of romance we discover what it was that the sleeping beauty
dreamt  and there are stories of other kinds  with a touch of pathos
too

story telling is the oldest of the arts  the art of which we never
tire  the art which will be out lived by none other  however
fascinating  however beautiful  however perfect  it may deal with human
thought and human passion  it may appeal to the highest intellect and
the profoundest sentiments of men  or just to the brightest and
dreamiest fancy of the young  be it but well told  even though it does
not stir our emotions  the little story delights the imagination  and
makes us grateful to the teller for an hour well spent or pleasantly
whiled away  that is the greatest reward of the writer  as it is the
sole ambition of the author of these little tales

the fish king and the dog fish

so you ve come to see the wizard   he said

its head was patted graciously

what a glorious ride that was

she stroked it  actually stroked it

taking the boy and girl by a hand  he led them

the little picture girl

in marched a stout beadle

then she accepted his invitation to dance

it is you  o prince  the youth of my dream

you can just hand over that pheasant

who are you  then

she ran and fetched his presents she was anxious to show

it was a very  very long ladder

the two reindeer     sped rapidly away

lay low  and hatched an audacious plot

of course your young majesty has got the key

i really do look every inch a king

looking neither to the right nor to the left

round about was nothing but mountains  craters  caverns

adventures in wizard land

all these poor creatures were children

he took two jewelled circlets out of a satchel

i am the bird fairy   she said

they met many a quaint creature

the wizard  with a groan of pain  had leapt back

lying full length on the ground next to his shattered invention

initial

he mounted it very carefully

smiled as she waved good bye

i suppose you know you re trespassing

monica the moon child

she was soaring like a bird right out into the night

a tiny figure  no bigger than monica s doll

rows upon rows of the beautifullest roses

the man lifted his arm so that his face was once
more hidden in gloom

chapter i

a knock at the red door


it s a shame  dulcie  we mayn t go out just because it s raining a few
drops   said the boy at the nursery window

yes  a fearful shame   replied his sister  she always sympathised with
him and gave in to him  right or wrong  she carefully propped her doll
bolt upright on a chair and came to where he stood   never mind  cyril
let s play at something

yes  but i do mind  it s too bad  it s always  you mustn t  this   you
mustn t  that  it would be a saving of breath if they d just say the few
things that we  might  do  are you willing to go on putting up with it
i suppose you are  as you re only a girl

no  i don t want to  but i ve got to  mother says it is for our good
and we are spoilt

i don t think so at all  it s very hard lines   growled cyril   i m
sure the garden isn t a bit wet  and the rocks have only a sprinkle

certainly the window panes had more than a sprinkle trickling down them
but the birds were twittering fussily in the bushes and amongst the ivy
and the garden was looking its best in the summer shower  fitful gleams
of sunshine cast loving touches here and there on the roses and the
sweet honeysuckle  and the tall white lilies never looked fresher or
smarter  beyond  were those tempting rocks  with their surroundings of
sand  which rose so strangely in that part of inland kent  telling of
former ages and of the vagaries of the sea and river  the rocks were the
happy playground of these lucky twins  who lived in the fine solitary
house close by  and who were now peering so disconsolately through the
window  flattening their noses against the glass blurred with the
pattering rain

they were exactly the same height  they resembled one another in
feature  and  being twins  were both nine years old  and there the
likeness ended  for his dark hair was short and thick  and hers was fair
and very long  she was timid and gentle though her bright face was very
happy  he  what is termed  a handful

i  know   exclaimed dulcie after a moment s silence  drawing her
brother away from the melancholy amusement of tracing down the trailing
drops with his finger until they disappeared mysteriously at the bottom
of the glass   i know  let s play  birds  beasts  and fishes

cyril cast a lingering look at the tiresome dark clouds  then with a
sigh and a frown turned round in token of consent  graciously suffered
himself to be settled at the table with paper and pencil  and was soon
excitedly trying to guess what dulcie s bird could be that began with
the letter c  had four between  and ended with an  e

it s very easy  really   pleaded dulcie  burning to tell   do you give
it up

cyril wasn t so easily beaten as that  and thought till he grew
impatient

shall i tell you    let  me tell you   urged his sister

if you like   he replied magnanimously

canare

i m sure it s spelt with a  y    he said  as if he weren t quite
certain in spite of his words

they argued who should score the mark  and settled the point by counting
it a draw  she followed it up with a fish  which was  s   two between
and an  l   which puzzled cyril until he found  of course  that it was
soul

believing he had lost again  he allowed his interest in the game to
flag  and still restless  he ran to the window

hooray  it s fine now   he cried   come along  we don t want hats

ought  we to go  do you think  cyril  without asking

i m not going to ask  not if i know it  we would be sure to be
don t  ed  i m going out  it s so stuffy here  you can do as you like

if you go  i shall go too   she replied quickly  following him and
taking his hand  he didn t quite like that  but he felt  as she was
only a woman   he would let her

away they ran lightly  out into the sunshine  happy to be in the warm
scented air  through the garden  off to the dear old rocks which were
already drying nicely  and at once a fine game of hide and seek was in
full swing

dulcie had gone again to hide  and cyril had his face buried in his
hands  waiting for the familiar  cuckoo   when he was startled instead
by a faint cry of surprise  followed by  cyril  come quick  quick

it must be a beetle or a toad  or something   he said to himself as he
hurried to the spot from which her voice seemed to come  but it was only
after she had repeated her excited cries that he found her at last

she had found a passage through the rocks which they had never noticed
before

come along   cried cyril joyously at the sight of it   come along
we ll go on a voyage of discovery



down the passage they went  far and carefully  for there was only a
glimmer of light in a thin streak peeping through  because the rocks all
but joined at the top  and the ground was uneven and slippery  but in
spite of their caution they got a sudden start  for they became aware of
a silent brook flowing deep and swiftly by  at their feet  another step
and they would have been in it  the twins  rather startled  looked at
one another  and then without further thought they just jumped across
jumped into an open space  into moonlight  there was actually a full
moon overhead  but with such seams and lines about it that it bore the
appearance of being pieced together like a geographical puzzle

cyril  look there   whispered dulcie  pressing close up to him  as soon
as she found words

in the white light there stood an immense rock  in it there was a wooden
door with hewn out steps leading up to it  a nice red door it was  with
a green knocker upon it in the shape of a mouth smiling a welcome  of
course they went up to it  climbed the steps  which were high and
difficult  and stared at the neatly engraved brass plate below it
which bore the words


knock if an answer is required
if not  why


i m going to knock   said cyril

oh no  we don t want any answer   said dulcie   so why do it

a backward glance at the steps puzzled her  for they had grown steeper
than before and impossible to climb down again  or up  for the matter of
that  and the door before which they stood was now at such a height from
the ground as to make her feel giddy to look below  she hardly had time
to think about it when cyril raised the knocker and let it go  instead
of the usual sound a knocker makes  a loud laugh rang out  discordant
and disconcerting   you needn t be frightened   he remarked  for his
little sister hung back and tightened her grasp of his arm  the next
moment the door swung open and there stood on the threshold a very tall
man with an enormous bald head  he was clad in a yellow satin
dressing gown  and wore great smoke coloured spectacles

so you ve come to see the wizard   he said blandly   pray walk in

illustration    so you ve come to see the wizard   he said

i  i think we d  we d rather not  thank you very much   stammered
cyril  very red  whilst dulcie looked up  pale and wondering   we re not
dressed for visiting   she urged in a loud whisper in her brother s ear

but you require an answer  or why knock   retorted the strange man
pray  walk in   he repeated  he was so polite

the door swung behind them  and the trembling twins found themselves
alone with the wizard in a very large cave  where the walls glowed with
phosphorescent light  while the further end was hidden in deep gloom




chapter ii

the wizard at home


how do you do   said the wizard  as if he remembered he had forgotten
to ask  the twins shyly shook hands with him and said they were quite
well  thank him  they didn t want to a bit  but he seemed to expect it
let s talk matters over   he added with a smile  it was such a winning
smile that the children began to feel less uncomfortable   you re not
always quite content  i believe   and he rubbed his hands cheerfully
together   that mother of yours interferes rather too much  eh   with a
rapid movement he pushed his spectacles away on to the top of his bumpy
baldness  revealing a pair of small eyes with a red  slumbering glow in
them

as cyril didn t reply dulcie ventured to remark   if you please  my
brother thinks she says  don t  too often

but how do you know that   interrupted cyril  who  though surprised
took a more practical view of the situation

because   slowly replied the wizard  taking off his spectacles and
scratching his big nose with them   because i was an optician in my
youth and made these glasses  through which i have only to look to see
people as they really are and not what they appear to be    how clever
broke in dulcie under her breath   i found out at a glance that you are
discontented with your lot  and prefer to be free  you are tired of
control  eh  isn t that the state of home affairs

yes   said cyril  once more full of his wrongs   it s only children who
are not allowed to do what they want  grown ups do as they like  so does
our dog  he goes out and comes in when he likes  eats when he wants
leaves what he likes  or rather  what he doesn t like  so does our cat
you see   he continued  growing quite chummy   we are never allowed to
do this  that  and the other  like other people  animals  i mean  and
they are free and happy  and they needn t bother with lessons  it s so
stupid being a child   he concluded plaintively  and dulcie nodded a
similar opinion

just as i thought  well  i shouldn t put up with it if i were you
replied their new friend  smiling again  and scratching his nose with
his spectacles in his thoughtful  insinuating manner   i should advise
you to go your own way  seek your own fortunes  and find your own
happiness for yourselves  we must see what we can do to help you to
freedom  eh

the little guests did not think to thank him  for their eyes had begun
to roam with curiosity over the strange things that were all about  the
cave dwelling was queerly furnished  if it could be called furniture
there were animals of all sizes and shapes  standing around stuffed
staring  and immovable  snakes  fish  small birds  an elephant just like
life standing rigidly next to a number of grinning stuffed monkeys
while a crocodile with open jaws looked snaps at a startled fawn with
wide set eyes  it was like a frozen zoological gardens

once upon a time   remarked the wizard  following the children s source
of interest   all those poor creatures were children like you  ah  their
end was sad  very sad  very sad indeed

the twins didn t like that remark at all  nor did they relish the
winning smile this time that accompanied it  then bursting out laughing
he exclaimed

now i ll show you something funny   and he brought out from a corner
what looked like a cinematograph   look   he said as he touched a spring
and set it going

there was a hissing sound  and the gloom at the end of the cave passed
away  and there marched along in living procession all the inhabitants
of their noah s ark

dulcie and cyril were transfixed with delight at this charming
entertainment

illustration    all those poor creatures were children

and we don t pay anything to come in   remarked cyril softly to his
sister   it can t pay him  they re all going in for safety  you see  all
the birds  all the beasts

where are the fishes   anxiously interrupted his little sister in a
whisper

don t be such a billy   retorted cyril with a frown   the fishes are
used to being drowned

after noah went into the ark and had shut the door  the gloom
reappeared  the show was over

that s a little idea of my own   remarked the wizard as he put the
machine away   amusing  isn t it

the twins nodded  then he invited the children to look through a hole in
the wall of the cave  and they saw a small room

that s my hospitable bedroom   he said   that i ve endowed myself with
when i m down in the mumps from being crouped up here so long  i go
there and wrap myself up in thoughts all nice and smug  it is fitted
with the epileptic light  rheumatic bells  and all the latest
infections

now  what were we talking about before  ah yes  my inventions  none of
your modern up to date rubbish  only inventions of the future for me
none of your wireless telephony and wireless telegraphy for me  listen
to this   he called out

number a  1  sea power  have you been successful in that last little
financial venture  sire

there were rushing sounds  as of waves  at the far end of the cave  and
a muffled voice replied

no  cabalistic one  i have lost again  just my luck  dash  sh  sh
which resolved itself into the swish swish of rolling surf  then all was
quiet again

the reply of a friend of mine residing far away at a place called  the
billows    explained the wizard in an offhand way   i help him in his
little transactions  which are sometimes rather  in fact very     and
raising his arm he smothered a laugh in his yellow satin sleeve which
was not pleasant to hear   i always like to laugh up there   he
explained  as the children looked surprised

dulcie s hand stole into her brother s and she whispered him to  come
away  come away  do  quick  and let s go home

but you haven t seen any of my marvellous jewellery yet   replied their
host  as though she had spoken aloud

don t be timid   he was looking at them through those horrid spectacles
again  which laid bare all their thoughts   you know i am only answering
that knock of yours  had you not required an answer  there would have
been no information forthcoming  i should just like to show you these
bracelets i have here   he pushed his glasses across his baldness and
took two jewelled golden circlets out of a satchel which hung from the
cord of his gown   other children have taken great interest in them
said the wizard slowly   in fact have worn all the gems out  but i ve
often had them done up again  and you are both welcome to them  very
welcome to them  if you like  you see   they  are able to inform their
wearers how to play at  birds  beasts  and fishes   properly

we know already   replied the boy and girl together  now restlessly
impatient to be gone

illustration   he took two jewelled circlets out of a satchel

i don t mean that tiresome educational game you were playing when you
were waiting in because of those few drops of rain  i mean the  real
thing  to be actually the real animals themselves in the realms of the
birds  beasts  and fishes  only in that way can children realise how
much nicer it is to be one of them  and to live a life free from the
don ts  and vexatious care of their elders  ah   now  you re
interested

the twins were staring at him open mouthed

these bracelets   continued the wizard  whilst the ten catseye gems in
each of them gleamed curiously as he spoke   see  aren t they
beautiful

these bracelets will empower the wearers to become bird  beast  or
fish  at each wish  to regain his shape  or her shape  at will  and to
live in any atmosphere  or in none  at every change of form a catseye
will disappear and return to me  with the last wish the wonderful
adventures will be over  and the shape last chosen will remain to the
end of existence  all these silly animals in my dwelling came at the
last to seek my help as they were dissatisfied  i did what i could
which wasn t much  of course i don t want so many of them here   he
added carelessly  scratching his nose with his glasses   though they do
help with my experiments  they do that  oh yes  but i always advise
getting experience first  they somehow got to know that  as children
under ten  they could only pass  into  my moonlight and never  out of
it   and that my faithful brook would not see them twice  so they came
for help in their last shapes as animals  oh   he added  pulling himself
up with evident pretence   i helped them right enough  they should have
kept a pair of catseyes  i warned them  and they might have crossed my
brook in some other shape than their own and changed to themselves the
other side  but somehow they were not fortunate enough to manage that
some people are so thoughtless  pray excuse me  my dears  there s some
one at the knocker   and throwing the bracelets into a corner where they
glittered strangely  the wizard vanished

come away  do come away   implored dulcie  plucking at her brother s
sleeve   i m so frightened   she whimpered   don t touch them  oh  i
want to go home

but  sis  you heard what he said  we can t cross his horrid brook twice
whilst we are under ten  crying won t help   replied the boy sturdily
nevertheless  he looked terribly frightened himself  although he patted
her shoulder comfortingly    i feel i must    he muttered   besides
it s our only way out of here  and get out of here we must  and escape
in some other shape

cyril hastily picked up the bracelets  put one on his wrist and the
other on dulcie s  and taking her by the hand dragged her right into the
gloomy part of the cavern farther and farther away from the hateful
dwelling and its awful master  he couldn t tell where he was leading
her  but he ran blindly on until at last there was daylight in the
distance  and the twins found themselves surrounded by haystacks
windmills  and other country objects

ah   exclaimed cyril with delight   see how i ve saved you  dulcie

and a good job too   she replied with conviction

so they wandered gaily on  laughing at anything and everything in the
happiness of their escape  they  were  happy  anyhow  happy in their
absolute freedom  and were they not in the possession  too  of the
precious bracelets which were going to lead them into all sorts of
delightful adventures as soon as they chose  they could talk of nothing
else  and babbled on of how they would cross the brook as animals  and
how they would be wiser than all the other poor creatures  by keeping a
gem in reserve and change to themselves on the other side

little could they guess of the troubles and adventures that awaited
them




chapter iii

the bird fairy speaks


the children had been so busy chattering of fun to come  that it was all
of a sudden they realised they were in a glade which looked quite
enchanting  and with so many daisies about that dulcie wanted to sit
down and weave those they gathered into a chain

don t wait for that   said cyril   carry them in my handkerchief

but when he felt in his pockets the handkerchief was not there  he must
have dropped it  dulcie proposed that they should retrace their steps
but sweet sounds of innumerable birds came from the high trees around
and filled the air  and they stayed to listen to the concert of trills
chirrups  gentle call notes  cadences  and bursts of tremulous song  and
now  against the deep blue sky hovered what looked like a cloud which
suddenly separated and descended  and the twins found themselves face to
face with a most lovely being  surrounded by a ring of exquisite little
creatures  who danced to the continuous music of the wood

cyril and dulcie gazed at their beautiful companion  who stepped towards
them smiling graciously  she looked like a lovely young girl  draped
about her was a wondrous garment of feathers of every hue  but she was
strange indeed  for her hands  clasped behind her  drew close together
two enormous wings which sprouted from her shoulders and formed part of
her white arms  whilst upon her shapely head among her black tresses was
the aigrette of the peacock  her attendants had no aigrette  and their
feathered draperies were of sober brown  they were much smaller too
smaller even than the twins

i am the bird fairy   she said in cooing tones   and you are in need of
advice  i can

illustration    i am the bird fairy   she said

not exactly  thanks  you  are  pretty   stammered cyril  interrupting
it s because  we want to go our own way  at home we    he stopped in
order to shake off dulcie  who was tugging at his jacket

if you please   asked dulcie shyly   what advice

it would be exactly contrary to the wizard s   and the fairy looked
serious

thanks very much   interrupted cyril   but we do want to seek our
fortunes  to go on our adventures  it s a grand thing to do   he
explained   specially for her  she s a girl  besides  we can t cross the
brook as children

don t use those catseyes and it might be possible  that is  if you are
willing  be warned  let me carry you quickly to the other side and then
run home   said the bird fairy anxiously

cyril shook his head  so dulcie shook hers

it s always  don t    he muttered   it s sure to be all right  dulcie
he said turning to her

are you sure   she inquired vaguely  with a lingering glance at the
fairy  who had turned away sadly

it must be if we keep that last change as we arranged

from the trees now issued forth sweet wood birds of many kinds  the air
was thick with them  they circled three times round the fairy ring and
then all flew away  and the children were once more alone

wasn t that beautiful  ah   sighed dulcie  looking after them   i wish
i could be one of them and sing like them

hardly were the words out of her mouth when cyril began to stare about
in amazement  his sister was nowhere to be seen  her disappearance was
so rapid that the earth might have swallowed her up

dulcie  dulcie   he cried   wherever are you  come back at once when i
tell you

nothing stirred in the stillness except the waving branches of the tall
trees  and a little bird that came and perched upon his shoulder and
began softly to trill into his ear what meant nothing to him  he stroked
its smooth plumage  his hand touched something hard around its throat
he parted the feathers and found  a golden circlet set with catseyes
one of which was missing

oh   he exclaimed   it s her

he was too flustered to talk grammar   how fearfully quick the change
came about  only just a slight hint like that  i say  we  shall  have
to look out  i wonder how you like it  you pretty little bird  i wish i
could understand those chirping sounds

instantly he became like her  a lark  he understood her at once  and the
pair flew away  singing gaily as they rose together  fluttering up and
up  soaring high and ever higher into the blue azure of the cloudless
sky

never was there such a blissful sensation as that  flying heavenwards to
the music of their own making  dancing at a party to the accompaniment
of a piano was mere ordinary child s play compared to the invigorating
delight of this new experience  the earth looked like a map  and they
realised now what was meant by a  bird s eye view   after a time  still
singing  they dropped quickly down to earth  then cyril led the way into
the wood  where they perched in one of the highest trees  and they
hopped about  scanning their surroundings  and awaiting the visits of
other little feathered inhabitants whose acquaintance they expected to
make  in the meantime they gleaned various scraps of news from certain
twitterings in the adjoining branches  some of which they clearly
overheard

and it came as a shock that these twitterings were mostly complaints
about the scarcity of provisions  about starvation among the weak birds
who could not compete against the strong  about the unfair scrambling
for tit bits which caused grievous bodily hurt  then a painful rumour
was discussed about poor little mother starling  who had been taken
unawares by a wild beast with terrible whiskers who was seen to pounce
upon her and carry her off  and her husband  who still went about vainly
calling his mate and would not be comforted  they heard how  in the
hospitals under the hedges  things were in a bad way  how one patient
was down with a broken wing  with no hope of getting well in time to
migrate  and of others incurable  and resigned

all this so depressed the two joyous young larks that they flew some
distance away  when through the leaves they discovered in the tree next
to them nothing less than the beautiful bird fairy reclining asleep in
the branches with her retinue of little sprites in various attitudes all
around her  their shining eyes wide open  on guard

the absolute silence proved too monotonous for our lively pair  so away
they flew again  miles and miles away into the open country  enjoying to
the fullest freedom found at last  feeding in the sun gilded fields
drinking from the pools  bathing in the sandy roads  and flying for all
they were worth in their youthful spirits  life like this was life
indeed

their happiness seemed complete  when a sudden sense of horror struck
them both at the same moment  and hardly had they realised it when they
noticed something very large which had been poised above swooping
towards them  striking terror into their souls as it came  it was a
sparrow hawk  and death was upon them  instinctively they swerved out of
its terrible course  and commenced a series of short  zig zag flights
their eyes starting nearly out of their little heads with fright  the
enemy was strong on the wing and remorseless in purpose  the poor larks
with hearts fluttering wildly  were becoming feeble and less alert  the
next second the hawk would seize one of its prey  the little bird gave
an agonised chirp  dropped like a stone to the ground  and changed into
dulcie  affrighted and panting for breath  she looked anxiously upwards
her pursuer  baulked  turned and darted upon its second quarry  too
late  cyril had taken the strong hint  had also wished  and now stood in
safety on the ground beside her

come on   he shouted to the surprised and baffled enemy   come on now
and i ll wring your ugly neck

but the bird didn t wait to accept his polite invitation  and a moment
later it was out of sight  and out of mind  and the children found they
were again alone in the beautiful glade

i don t want to be a bird any more   said dulcie when she had recovered
her composure

no  it s too risky   admitted her brother   when that big dark thing
came in sight there was so little time to think what to do  that second
too   he added with a shudder   when i thought the brute had got you
was too awful

she felt quite important now at having gone through such peril

i could never have imagined that birds had such a lot to put up with
mused cyril as they walked on   hunger and suffering  with the risk any
moment of being gobbled up

there ought to be some one to take care of the poor things   remarked
dulcie   if it hadn t been for the catseyes we should have been eaten up
and ended like that   she glanced at the bracelet on her wrist and
added  with a timid look at her brother   it seems safer as we are

bosh   he rejoined   we want adventures  that s what we re going
for  and freedom  we had a ripping time as larks  till the end  it
certainly wasn t very comfortable then




chapter iv

the lost catseye


something was in their path  the twins stooped to examine it and found
it to be a hedgehog standing on its hind legs  motionless  as though
waiting for somebody  and a smile was upon the face of that hedgehog
all at once a porcupine sprung up beside it  as if out of the earth  and
the two appeared on the very best of terms

i  must  get to know what they are talking about   exclaimed dulcie
they seem to me to be arguing about something interesting  oh  i do
wish i could be all ears and understand them  if only i were something
as small as a mole   before cyril could remonstrate a mole she was  went
off blindly  and was quickly lost to view amongst the thick brushwood

i say  i do call that  mean    he complained   without even so much as
asking my advice or saying good bye  it s silly to become a stupid mole
it s a waste of a catseye  and all on account of a beastly spikey
hedgehog and a beastly prickly porcupine  halloa  wherever have you all
got to

out of humour  he looked right and left  they were nowhere to be seen
i hope she will soon come to her senses   he muttered   it isn t much
fun being left like this

he lay down on his back to await her  and kicked up his legs in the air
as a pastime  whilst the tall trees above him waved their upper branches
in the breeze  his glittering bracelet caught his attention  causing his
thoughts to drift on adventures past and to come  he looked harder at
it  and becoming concerned he carefully counted the missing catseyes  he
had only wished to be a lark  and to be himself  yet three were gone
the two first  and the  last  one   could this   he asked himself   be
some dreadful trick of the wizard s  likely to occur at the last   cyril
turned pale at the possibility   or could that last one have become
loose and got lost   he pondered  if so  he realised that it must be
found  the thought about the wizard worried him  he was uneasy  too
about dulcie  and sat up eagerly listening for her coming  and wondering
what he had better do

meanwhile  our little mole had groped its way to a hole whence could be
heard sounds of a quaint voice  it was that of the porcupine saying
pretty poetry softly to the accompaniment of a slow musical titter

i m a brave and dashing porcupine
strong  elegant  and dandy
and you a hedgehog  bright as wine
and sweet as sugar candy
dear hedgehog fair  say you ll be mine
and wed the dandy porcupine
dear hedgehog  bright as currant wine
take me  as strong as brandy
be mrs  porcupine  i pray
i ve begged so often  don t say nay
be mrs  porky  sweet and jolly
nay  titter not
or off i ll trot
and straightway marry molly

ah   he observed after a long pause  during which the hedgehog had
remained silent and had never moved a quill in response   there goes
molly the mole

molly the mole  who had distracted his attention  heeded him not  but
went and struck up an acquaintance with the little stranger in the hole
close by  for some time they remained in close conversation  it was not
at all an amusing conversation  as dulcie explained later  and she was
not sorry when the danger of a horse s hoofs galloping nearly on top of
them caused them to run off  they got separated  and dulcie was glad to
bring herself again into the possession of her own five senses  peeping
from behind a tree  she saw molly and the hedgehog walking off together
leaving the porcupine disconsolate  and then she beheld a young girl
with short red hair dismount from her horse  walk back rapidly towards
some glittering object  and pick it up

dulcie recognised at once the curious colouring of a catseye  she
glanced at the bracelet on her wrist  all was in order there  could it
possibly belong to cyril  the thought became a certainty   stop   she
called out loudly

too late  horse and rider were off

stop  stop thief   shouted dulcie as she ran after them as fast as she
could

now cyril  who was not the soul of patience at any time  had come to the
conclusion that it was of no use waiting any longer  and that it would
be better to be up and doing  so he got up and pondered again and again
what to do

any way i d better risk it and become a cat   he decided   for like
that i ve more chance of finding dulcie  and of finding my catseye  it
would be useful to be able to see in dark corners  but i ll search about
as i am first

he spent some time peering and searching in the wood  but without
success  neither dulcie nor the catseye was to be found

just then he heard a noise  he stepped behind a tree  and peering round
from behind it he beheld not far off a young lady dismount from her
horse and pick up something  cyril recognised it as his catseye  he
approached timidly to claim it  when she leapt up and cantered off
evidently not seeing or hearing the boy who was running  shouting with
lusty lungs   stop  hi  stop thief

little did he know that his little sister  almost exhausted  was further
behind gasping out the same cry  while big tears from helplessness and
anxiety were coursing down her hot cheeks  for the trees hid the
children from view at the distance they were apart  as well as from the
rider  and shout as they would  their cries could not be heard by one
another

cyril soon lost sight of the new owner of the gem  and didn t know what
to do  or where to trace it  or  still worse  what had become of dulcie
as he came to a narrow footpath which branched off from the main track
he went quickly along it in the hope that it might prove to be a short
cut to somewhere  as it turned out he was lucky  for it proved to be a
short cut to a town  and hardly had he entered one of the streets than
at the other end he saw entering it the rider on her horse  he ran
towards her  but only arrived just as the girl with red hair disappeared
through the door of a large white house  and the horse was being ridden
off by her groom

so cyril sauntered on  anxiously meditating how to get his belonging
back  the present possessor would never believe his tale  or if she did
the less likely would she be to part with a thing so valuable  and then
perhaps only for a hundred pounds  he concluded he must take it  it was
his  at least it was more his than hers  and his life might depend upon
it  so he decided that the best thing he could do was to change into a
monkey  climb into the house by one of the open windows  grab the gem as
soon as found  and escape as quickly as he could

but no sooner did the quaint little monkey stand there than it was
pounced upon by a dirty brown hand  whilst a foreign voice exclaimed

ah  ha  so dere you are  my leetle friend  you shall not escape from me
again so soon  jacko  ah no

it was a ragged boy with a hurdy gurdy  who had caught hold of the
little twisting  mouthing creature and was already getting it into a
miniature soldier s coat with brass buttons  a ludicrous doll s hat with
a long feather upstanding was quickly produced from his pocket  put on
its head  and the elastic slipped under its chin  a long cord was
whipped out  fixed to the red coat  and a sudden jerk hitched up the
whole arrangement on to the barrel organ in a twinkling

now dulcie had also taken the short cut into the town  and was just
going to enter a large garden in order to rest her weary limbs after her
useless chase  when the boy and monkey attracted her attention and she
stopped  she would have laughed  so comic was the sight  but filled with
concern at a rough jerk she cried   oh  please don t  you ll hurt it  do
let it go

let go  signorina  ah no  me take care never risk no more  no jacko
then poor pietro starve  just you watch him  then give poor pietro
penny  now  jacko  we re  ungry

had dulcie only known the monkey was not jacko  but cyril  she would
have been still more concerned  the lad turned the handle of the
instrument  and to its cracked tune she was amused to see the monkey
take off its hat with a jerky movement  replace it  dance about  salute
and perform other antics in the most approved and undignified manner

the boy pulled his forelock  after much fumbling dulcie found a penny
and gave it to him  a sunny smile was on his swarthy face as he said
grazia   he kissed the monkey affectionately  and putting it in the
inner pocket of his ragged coat  moved away

and the monkey  peering out of that pocket  blinked twice so meaningly
at dulcie that she stood there and gazed after it  puzzled  whilst the
boy trudged off whistling  dulcie then found a shady seat  and having
nothing better or more hopeful to do  determined to rest there  now
however  that she had leisure to think it over  she didn t at all like
the loss of that gem  supposing by some trick or other of that horrid
wizard all the rest should drop out and not be found  at some dreadfully
awkward moment  what would poor cyril do  and she also might come to be
in the same plight  these thoughts were too horrible  so she began
saying some poetry she had learnt in order to keep her mind on other
matters

she wasn t enjoying herself very much  the time seemed endless  and a
neighbouring clock which chimed the quarters didn t help it to pass any
faster  and the longer dulcie waited  the more anxious she became  she
gave up reciting poetry  or what stood for poetry  and her only thought
became   if only cyril would come back   in her fear she began to give
up hope of his ever coming back at all  and decided to try and discover
if there were such a thing as a policeman about  to whom she might
confide her troubles

suddenly there arose a hullabaloo  such a barking and rushing  and the
next moment a large black cat sprang on the seat beside her
frightening her very much  there was a terrified shriek  a gratified
wish  and cyril found himself on a bench next dulcie with a great hound
clinging to his sailor collar at the back

with a cry of fear she helped him in his struggles to get free  the
animal  astonished and abashed  slunk away with its tail between its
legs  and the brother and sister fell into one another s arms  never
before had they known how fond they were of one another  for never had
they been so pleased to meet again

i waited so patiently   said dulcie  she didn t add anything about
thoughts of a friendly policeman  but inquired quickly

do you know you ve lost your catseye

he nodded and grinned

have you got it

he parted his lips  it was between his teeth  he pressed it back into
the empty setting of his bracelet  saying

i d no time to wish sooner  i ll never set towser to chase our poor
little miranda again  you bet  how horrid it must be to be a permanent
cat

however did you get it back

hallo  hi   was all she got in answer  and the next moment he was
pommelling into  and being pommelled by  a lanky youth

i ll teach you  to shy stones  at a  poor defenceless  cat   gasped
cyril  hitting out right and left  his face scarlet  and his hair all
ruffled  how they did go for one another  first one was down and the
other on top  then the pair  all legs and arms  were the other way up
then they rolled together over and over  till at last cyril had won a
brilliant victory before he allowed dulcie to drag him away from the
defeated adversary  who  as soon as he was free  slunk off miserably
with one hand to his eye and his handkerchief to his nose

i m all right   exclaimed cyril  in answer to her anxious inquiry
shaking himself into order   that  was  a lark  no  i m not hurt  not
really  served him jolly

dulcie noticed that he had a lump on his forehead from the fray

i m glad you won the fight with that boy  but i don t know what it was
about one little bit  and  cyril  aren t these adventures rather
too  too dangerous  don t you think

of course they re not  they re awfully jolly

now tell me all about it from the very beginning   said his sister as
they strolled off together  so cyril gave her a spirited record of his
adventures whilst she listened eagerly  anxious not to miss a single
word

i ll begin at the beginning   he said   well  the funny monkey  me  you
know

you   cyril   and dulcie gasped with surprise

yes  don t interrupt  there s a dear  i quite enjoyed my little
performance on the organ before you  but by the second and third time i
had to do it i got sick and tired of it  the weather seemed to turn cold
and made me shiver  then i got fearfully hungry  coppers were given me
but no food did i get  and i felt i had had enough of the business  the
boy s pocket  too  was draughty  there was a hole in it  besides which i
got the cramp  it wouldn t have been much use trying to escape  besides
the monkey idea was all wrong  for people were passing all the time
and  had they noticed a free monkey on the track of a catseye  a crowd
would have collected  and perhaps that grinning idiot might have gone
for me again  i couldn t very well change to myself inside of his
jacket  nor during a performance in public  as it might have attracted
attention  so i was obliged to wait for my chance  which came at last
when he picked up an end of a cigarette and after begging a match was
busy lighting it at a sheltered corner  i was on the pavement in a
minute  managed to slip out of my idiotic red coat to which the cord was
attached  flung off that absurd hat  and remembering my first idea i
changed into a cat  calmly sat down on the inner side of some area
railings  and peered through to watch the fun

yes  and what happened then   interrupted dulcie excitedly

well  you never saw such a face as that boy s when he found the
monkey s coat and hat on the ground without any monkey inside of them
he said some foreign words and commenced running about hunting for me
everywhere  whilst i trotted off before his very eyes  ha  ha  ha

his sister pealed with laughter and delight

as quickly as possible i reached the big house where i had seen the
girl with the red hair go in after she had picked up my catseye

i saw her pick it up  too   broke in dulcie

but cyril went on   the windows were still open  i jumped up from the
balcony on to a stone ledge  and then by good luck right into the
bedroom of that bothersome young lady  she was reading a book  we did
startle one another

oh  you darling sweet pussikins   she said   ah   i thought   not so
darling as all that   and the next moment i was lifted clumsily on to
her lap and stroked and patted  whilst i looked anxiously around for my
catseye in the intervals  when she wasn t kissing my nose  which was
disturbing and uncomfortable  and girls do like kissing so  then i saw
it gleaming on the dressing table close to the window all the time  and
i became impatient  the stupid baby language and kisses bothered me  so
i stopped it by giving her face an ugly scratch

oh  how rude   exclaimed dulcie  shocked

whereupon she gave me an angry slap  which i didn t feel a bit through
the fur  and pushed me down roughly on the floor  looked at her face in
the glass  and then i heard her bathing it in the dressing room  i say
had i changed then  wouldn t she have been jolly surprised to find a
strange boy in there  so  remaining her darling pussikins   he continued
with a smile   i just jumped on the table  took hold of my catseye in my
mouth  and escaped by the window before she returned  and waved my tail
in good bye  stupid things  tails   with a laugh  which was echoed by
dulcie  cyril  grown serious again  went on with his narrative

but just as i alighted on the ground a boy began shying stones at me
which it was awfully difficult to dodge  one of them caught me such a
whack on the side  and he laughed and shouted  hurrah  got him    wasn t
i glad when i saw him just now   well  i was just going to change then
when there was a great barking  and a whole lot of dogs seemed to be
bearing down on me  i thought i d make myself scarce  so i tore off
and as they were on my track i simply cut  i flew along the muddy
streets with the whole pack at my heels  with shouts and laughter
ringing in my ears  scampering past them  past houses  past traffic
whizzing along for my life with the barking din and the pattering feet
always following  at last  as a last hope  i dodged round  doubled back
the noise stopped  and i took refuge in a quiet garden  awfully puffed
and jumped on a seat next some one resting there

me   said dulcie  with a sigh of relief

yes  i found it was you  sis  i wished  and you re a trump  for i was
tired  and you rid me of that big dog   dulcie glowed with pride and
pleasure at that   i never knew  though  that that brute was following
me  fortunately for me he gripped hold of the bracelet round my neck

how well you tell a story  cyril   she said simply

cyril smiled contentedly   that s nothing

then she inquired anxiously   do you think it was the wizard s trick
that losing of the stone

p raps   replied cyril musingly   he s quite ugly enough for anything
but i don t think so   he added reassuringly   it must have been an
accident  got loose  or something

dulcie s mind being eased  she then told her own story as a mole  she
couldn t remember the porcupine s verses exactly  but she repeated what
she could  and they had a good laugh over them   before  she had been
blind to the fun in them   i repeated them to molly   continued dulcie
rippling over with fun   and she was so offended she vowed she d never
marry him  so i cured him of his vanity  and serve him right

but why did the hedgehog titter  that was what you wanted to find out
wasn t it   asked cyril

i suppose it was expecting the porcupine s verses

suppose

i forgot to ask

cyril expressed his opinion that she had been a softy  that those
creatures weren t worth while chumming up with  and they couldn t have
much sense  and it didn t matter  after all  what they thought or did

i shan t tell you any more  then   replied dulcie  offended

yes  do   begged cyril  curious to know the end  so after he had begged
three times  she gave way  and informed him she was glad never to have
been born a mole  for molly was in terribly low spirits and had
apologised for them  but the reason was because all her family s skins
had been taken off their backs in order to keep fashionable ladies from
taking cold  as these ladies seemed to think that it was a prettier and
warmer skin than their own  and molly hourly expected each moment to be
her last  and advised her new found friend to prepare for the same
fate  which was all very terrifying   so i made haste to wish to be my
own self again   concluded dulcie

cyril made her promise faithfully never again to run off like a mole or
anything else  which  being only too anxious to avoid another
separation  she willingly did

the poor animals   she remarked earnestly   all seem so helpless
there s no one ever to take their part or help them

ah  you think that because we ve not yet changed into something really
great   answered cyril with conviction

what a gloomy looking place we ve come to  i was so interested
listening and talking  i didn t notice the way we ve come   broke in his
sister  gazing at what appeared like a jungle in front of them
surprising how we got here  isn t it

i never noticed either  but it ll do beautifully   replied the boy
quite satisfied

but it doesn t seem very nice to be a beast   argued dulcie
reflectively  her thoughts harking back   somehow it s so unpeaceful

i tell you that s because we haven t tried anything great   repeated
her brother with an emphatic movement of his hand and a decided toss of
his head    if    he said  and hesitated    if  we were lions   he
waited  then finding they were both as they were he went on  reassured
then we would know what it is to rule everybody  keep our friends in
order  and eat up our enemies

but i don t want to eat up any one   protested dulcie   i think it
would be very disagreeable

i should think it must taste rather nice   they  like it  besides  one
never knows till one tries   remarked her brother   i want to be a
lion

at once the king of beasts confronted dulcie  with a shriek she tore
away as fast as her small feet could scamper  then she changed her mind
and as a lioness  full of courage  she rejoined him

grand beasts they were as they bounded into the jungle with a mighty
roar  startled creatures hurried out of their path  and the very
landscape appeared insignificant in their presence  monarchs of all they
surveyed  this at last was splendid freedom

at a river  sparkling like glass in the burning sun  they stopped and
slaked their thirst  lapping up the water greedily  then they turned
again into the tangle of vegetation and laid themselves down to rest

purring with delight in the hot sunshine  they lazily lashed their
tails  the lion was just dozing when he was roused by something heavy
and strong winding itself in great coils around his limbs and body  he
gave forth a roar half of anger  half of fear  struggle as he would he
could not free himself  it was a huge boa constrictor that was closing
about him like bands of iron  and was just about to crush him to death
when the lion disappeared and a little boy in a blue serge suit wriggled
away  sobbing out   oh  mother  dulcie

just then cyril s eye caught sight of a rifle pointed from a
neighbouring tree  to his horror it was aimed straight at the recumbent
lazily blinking lioness  his heart stood still with terror  he could
neither scream nor stir  quite forgotten was the huge reptile  which had
jerked back its head in astonishment at the remarkable disappearance of
its quarry  with an undulating movement of surprise in that part of its
anatomy which might be termed its neck  but now the creature was quite
close to the lad and rearing itself up to strike at him when  crack
crack  crack  bullets were whizzing all around  cyril  bewildered
stumbled over the dead body of the reptile and fell to the ground  the
next moment he felt dulcie s hair over his face as she pulled him on to
his feet

great snakes   exclaimed lord algy  captain waring  who was eagerly
peering through the branches of another tree close by  laughed as he
rejoined   only one  my friend

eh  what  well i m    drawled his lordship  craning his neck and
letting his eyeglass drop and dangle  he had stopped short in his
sentence  not seeming quite to realise what he was   by jove   he now
added   i certainly thought i hit one of those two fine brutes  most
remarkable thing i ever saw in my life

didn t  see  you mean  my dear algy   replied the captain coolly and
not without vexation    i ve  seen a dead serpent before  where have
they moved to  that s the question  we shall have to track them again  a
dead snake in the grass is not worth two fine lions in the jungle

no  my dear fellow  i don t think so either  i agree with you
there  it s quite the contrary  of course   remarked his lordship with a
certain amount of energy

meanwhile  dulcie and cyril  with white  scared faces  were fleeing hand
in hand like pixies among the trees




chapter v

in the fish king s realm


it was only when they reached a meadow full of wild flowers  and the
twins  worn out with their long run  lay down to rest  that dulcie
remarked with a sigh of relief

we never do seem to be so safe as when we are us

we won t be birds nor beasts any more   replied cyril   hark  what s
that snoring so loud

it s not snoring  i believe it s the waves   saying which dulcie jumped
up and cyril did the same  the children found the meadow they were in
was on a cliff  and that below were far reaching sands  and in the
distance heaved the glorious deep blue sea

they clapped their hands and danced with delight  and when that
performance was over they carefully descended the steps cut in the face
of the cliff which led down to the shore

very soon their shoes and stockings were slung round their necks  and
they were running over the hot sand to where the wavelets came rippling
to meet their little feet

so immersed were they in paddling that it was a little time before they
noticed some one sitting amongst the rocks which peeped out of the
surface of the ocean a short distance away  a hand was beckoning to
them  and thinking it might be some one who wanted help  cyril declared
he would go to the rescue  and began to wade towards the spot

dulcie  fearful of his going alone  and not wishing to be left behind in
the adventure  hurried next to him  the current was rather strong and
the water got deeper as they went  but they didn t think of their
clothes  which were no longer wholly dry   but only of the rescue  when
they reached the rocks they found to their surprise a very quaint figure
calmly seated there  who motioned them in a very grand manner to a place
on each side of him   pray be seated  good morning

good morning   exclaimed the visitors politely  taking the places
indicated

good afternoon   said the fish king   do you mind holding my crown one
moment  my dear

dulcie took it with awe  he was a very fine gentleman indeed  and the
two children couldn t help staring at him as he smoothed his hair in
silence  he was short and stout  in a costume not unlike that of
harlequin in the pantomime  only the colouring was green and blue  his
goggle green eyes and wide  down drawn mouth made him look comically
like a carp  whilst the pointed wisp of white beard on his chin and the
four long white hairs he was winding round his bald head were not really
an improvement to his appearance

thank you kindly  my dear   he said as he took his crown and put it on
it was beautifully made  entirely of the loveliest small shells  and
when he wore it he looked every inch just what he happened to be

in spite of his queer face  the two visitors felt quite at ease with
him  and were sure that with such a pleasant voice  too  he must be very
nice indeed

what are you king of   inquired dulcie with a friendly smile

of the fish   he answered  patting her cheek   i m right glad to see
you

suddenly remembering  the little couple at once donned their shoes and
stockings as a sign of respect

it s very healthy  i suppose   remarked dulcie   living out at sea like
this

i suppose so  my lady   answered the fish king drily  dulcie liked
being called  my lady    except   he continued thoughtfully   for an
occasional attack of shingles i don t ail much   then turning to cyril
he asked   how s that old rascal of a wizard  laughing in his
dressing gown  eh

i m sorry i don t know  your majesty   replied the boy  surprised at
the question and the way it was put

you will soon get to know me  i only hope you may not be disappointed
you certainly wouldn t have been disappointed with my ancestor

who s your ancestor   asked dulcie bluntly   was he a king fisher too

not at all  he was neptune

where did he live

in imagination

where s that

cyril raised his eyebrows at her lack of manners

you turn to the right   answered his majesty patiently  with a gesture
that way   follow your nose  mount a hill north of the fore head  and
there you are  see

the twins couldn t think what answer to make  though he seemed to expect
one  so they gave a little nervous laugh

just see  there s a dear boy   said the fish king kindly  in order to
change the subject   just see if you ve got a copy of the  financial
market  about you  will you  or maybe you know what the financial time
is  that would do quite as well  oh  beg pardon  i see you ve no watch
on  pawnbroken  eh

i m afraid i don t know what you mean  i ve never heard of all that
admitted cyril

but you  have  heard there s been another slump

what   ventured dulcie

in what  why  in seaweed  of course  just my luck  fishy transactions
never do pay  though they always promise to  but   he added  rousing
himself  dismal still   you must both come down soon and have a cup of
sea or something  it s my birthday  and there s going to be jinks
below

birthday  how delightful   said dulcie

why  how old can you possibly be   asked cyril   if it s not impolite
to ask

quite right  let me see   said the fish king thoughtfully   ah  now i
remember  i m just several millions of years  it takes a little time to
fix the number exactly  and eleven days

that  is  old  sire   murmured dulcie as she regained her breath  which
had been taken away at the idea of so many birthdays

old  nonsense  my lady

how can it be  and eleven days  if it s your birthday  your worship
asked cyril  thinking he d go one better than sire

because  my philosopher  i prefer the new fangled calendar which puts
one on eleven days  in that way  when i m told i don t look my age  i
know it s true  and not flattery  see

the children were not quite satisfied with the explanation
nevertheless  they were pleased to find it the most natural thing in the
world to be getting chummy with a fish king

now  do come below waves and have a cup of sea or something   he
repeated  looking appealingly first at one and then at the other

thank you very much   replied his little guests   but   said the
cautious dulcie   sha n t we be drownded

you both have your catseyes on  i presume   and his majesty stared
anxiously in their faces   yes  i see you have  very well  then  sit
steady  halloa there   shouting downwards   lift  please   then
muttering   it s high time we went   he smiled  his smile was so
unutterably comic that it was to a merry burst of childish laughter that
all the rocks descended as quickly as the tide rose above them  and the
trio  smiling still  found themselves gently deposited at the bottom of
the ocean

wonderful thing water pressure   remarked the fish king  then  helping
them off the rocks  he added with a gracious wave of the hand   welcome
to my domain   and the twins bowed so prettily that he appeared much
gratified

ah   he said  taking them by the hand and stopping still   i see fido
fido  fido   at his call a fine dog fish came forward at a fast swim
and its head was patted graciously  whilst its tail wagged with
contentment   now   resumed his majesty   we ll go to the revels   and
they proceeded at a smart walk as buoyantly through the clear water as
through air

the sea scape was perfectly beautiful  but as the fish king once more
seemed deep in melancholy  the twins gazed silently around  they were
evidently walking along the king s road  for it was wide enough to walk
three abreast  the sand was so fine and glittering that it looked like
gold dust  the path was bordered by exquisite shells  on either side
were gardens of variegated anemones  here and there an old sodden boot
lay about untidily  at which the fish king frowned and looked uneasy
they passed oyster beds  where  besides oysters  all sorts of fish
large and small  were fast asleep  breathing heavily with their mouths
wide open  now and again a squadron of lobsters or jelly fish would
confront them  and respectfully divide and wait until the royal
procession of three had passed through

at last they came to a great object ahead which turned out to be a
sunken ship  and the children heard the fish king say   welcome  my
dears  to my home  i hope your visit to  the billows  will please you
they eagerly assured him it would  for they felt certain they were going
to have a jolly time

on board everything was most snug and trim  and in the large saloon he
led his two little guests to one end of the long table  where they found
biscuits  tinned meats  jam  and other nice things  which they enjoyed
very much  whilst their host looked on with a satisfied expression

now  will you take a cup of something   he asked  and seemed relieved
when they declined with thanks   i m a seatotaller myself   he observed
i don t drink like a fish  nor go in for cups

i m glad we said  no  thank you    whispered dulcie to cyril  who
nodded assent   why are you so sad  mr  fish king   she asked when she
had satisfied her hunger  and she stroked his great flabby hand

he didn t answer for a moment  then trying to twist up his mouth into a
smile he said as he roused himself   i fear i m somewhat glum for a
birthday party  but i ve had so many of them  besides  i m bothered
about the slump  one would think seaweed safe enough for a vested
interest  surely  from all accounts  they must have been cooked  softly
too  in the bargain  can you make it out  my dears

illustration   its head was patted graciously

the twins couldn t understand it at all  and shook their heads quite
emphatically over the matter

now  let s go abaft   suggested his majesty  he rose  and looked at
them with a ray of cheerfulness   we ll watch the water sports  i revel
in them when they are good  usually they go bad

the children readily agreed   it s lucky you happened to come on my
birthday   he continued   for you may be amused  here s a list of the
different courses   and he took up a menu from the table   they ll race
through them like old boots

do they race better than new ones   inquired cyril

they ve more experience   replied his majesty   what is about to
begin   he said quite gaily as they followed him up the gangway
is  let me see  ah yes   turtle mocked   now just look at fido   he
leaned over the side  the twins did likewise   he s turning turtle   and
the three watched with approval the antics of the dog fish as he turned
his somersaults  and they applauded this first item on the programme

next innings   shouted his majesty   fish balls bowled   he read from
the menu  and taking their plaice  a game of cricket began   they think
they can play   he whispered   and that is the way i humour them  or
they might begin to cry  and i hate anything that reminds me of blubber
but how can any one in their senses imagine plaice fielding at slip
why  they don t know cricket from a bat  nor never will at this rate  i
should think

once in london  we saw such a lot of fish in the big shops there
volunteered dulcie in a burst of confidence  the next moment she wished
she hadn t spoken  for cyril was frowning at her and shaking his head
she glanced timidly at the fish king  he evidently didn t mind  for he
merely remarked with a sigh   ah dear  one of these days my poor
subjects will be sucked from the sea through a 2d  tube  straight to
billingsgate  i suppose that ll be the time for slumps and no mistake

i suppress the sole and eel course   he cried suddenly  there was a
great stir in the water at this intimation   it s a dance   he muttered
let s get on with the cod stakes   he put down the menu and threw
overboard some nets and fishing tackle  then began a highly amusing
exhibition by old fish showing the young ones how to nibble the bait
without taking the hook  and if taken by some mischance  how to get
unhooked  how to avoid the nets  and other life saving dodges which his
majesty explained to the astonished twins

but hardly had he finished when a fat young gurnet who was taking part
in the sports did get hooked  and clumsily extricating himself went off
leaving a thin red track behind him

the poor thing is hurt   exclaimed dulcie

oh no   said the king   a herring bone stitch is all that s necessary

i know how to do that   replied dulcie   but i thought it was only used
to make dress things look pretty  i never heard of it for mending fish
the excitement continued unabated

when the revels were over  the little strangers expressed their
enjoyment of the birthday party  and thought perhaps they ought to be
saying good bye  their kind host wouldn t hear of their going yet  they
hadn t even seen the cable which he was just going to visit

who s won the prizes   asked cyril as they got off the ship

i have   replied his majesty

not the winners of the races and of the sports   said the boy  in
amazement

they can t expect to win the races and win the prizes too   i  have won
the prizes

what have you won  your worship

i forget   he answered vaguely   i ve won so many in all these years
and they get so mis laid  for all the world like addled eggs

but you ve only just    commenced cyril

don t tease   said dulcie  pulling at her brother s sleeve  and so the
matter dropped

whilst cyril and the fish king were talking about the price the crown
might fetch were he obliged to part with it on account of his recent
financial losses  dulcie was so busy admiring the beautiful creatures
swimming about  that she stumbled and fell before her companions could
warn her that the cable was lying in her path  she was soon up  and it
was the fish king now who was lying prone on the ground  but his
attitude was intentional  he was listening intently  at a sign from him
they did likewise  the billows overhead were lashing up the spray  and
through the rushing sound could be vaguely heard   number a  1  sea
power  has that nice little venture proved successful  sire

it was the wizard s voice  the twins stared at one another with startled
eyes

no  thou cabalistic one   shouted the fish king  and got up with an
impatient sigh  so he didn t hear what sounded like the echo of mocking
laughter which the children recognised before they rejoined him   some
one s at the bottom of that business  i ll be bound   he grumbled   i m
afraid i m too green  and ye gods and little fishes alone know how i
manage to be  for i ve a fit of the blues often enough   and he glanced
at the garment he wore   now come and inspect my workhouse   he led them
away in silence to a small lugger  also wrecked  commandeered by his
majesty

what a lot of residences you have  sire   remarked dulcie timidly
realising the situation

one must  if one is a royalty   he replied   i have even more than the
german emperor  i ve one for eating in  one for thinking in  one for not
thinking in  and a host of others  there is one which takes me eighteen
hours to reach  where i go at cradle time  where the waves hush me to
sleep with their lullaby  you have heard it   rocked in the cradle of
the deep   eh

yes  yes   assented the twins readily

his glum face slightly relaxed  then he continued   it s always a matter
of interest to me when my ship comes home  i don t whistle for it  i
squall for it  look out for squalls  for i feel restless  and in my
family carping is our form of humour

once inside the cabin of the lugger the fish king took an immense ruler
and sitting upon the table in front of a high heap of foolscap began
ruling one wave after another  absorbed in his occupation  his mouth
tightly drawn down  he looked more than ever like a carp  he kept on
ruling the waves  heeding neither the little coughs  the little
fidgetings  or the little hints  entreaties  regrets  or excuses of the
twins  until  exasperated at his sudden and unaccountable oblivion to
their existence  they murmured broken words of thanks for his past
kindness  and  not a little indignant  they walked out of the cabin
jumped over the side of the ship  and swam upwards  they met many a
quaint creature  and then diving below they rested in a quiet spot again
amongst beautiful shells  at last in peaceful calmness at the bottom of
the sea  alone with the heaving waves palpitating far above them

talking over the strange conduct of the fish king  it occurred to cyril
that the fact of parting from them risked reminding him of blubber
which he hated  as he had told them before  so he must have preferred
ignoring them altogether  especially as he had work to do  but dulcie
thought perhaps they might see him again when he was not so busy

it must be rather jolly being a crowned head   mused cyril   i vote we
have a shy at another catseye  so as to have a gorgeous crown and boss
everything and everybody

dulcie  dazzled at such a magnificent prospect  readily agreed

i wish i were a crowned head   exclaimed cyril excitedly

i wish i were a crowned head   repeated dulcie with fervour

illustration   they met many a quaint creature

they stared at one another  no change had come  dulcie was the first to
understand their failure

of course not   she remarked   how stupid of us  it s a bird  beast  or
fish we have to choose  not a crowned head

so her brother  to change the subject  drew her attention to an eel that
was trying to turn head over     wriggling in a very upside down
fashion  tired of watching it  they lay chest downwards  and  supporting
themselves on their elbows  kicked up their own heels

do you believe there is such a thing as a sea serpent  little sis
inquired cyril lazily

i believe there are sometimes  when they are in season

well  i can tell you there are  not   and the only season they  are  in
is the silly season  father says so

it s so lovely down here  and you re spoiling it all  cyril  by
arguing  i do think it would be nice   she added  glancing round   to be
an oyster and have a real pearl  i wished i possessed a real pearl

shut up   cried cyril  but to his annoyance he found his sister already
gone  and a stupid looking  closed up oyster in her place  out of which
he could not get a glimmer of satisfaction

you  have  shut up and no mistake   he said severely   in the middle of
a conversation too   however  she was soon at his side again  and looked
very sorry

well  what was it like   was his laconic welcome  accompanied by a
glance of disapproval

not at all nice  i didn t want to remain  although i possessed a
magnificent pearl  i felt so horribly ill  as though i had some dreadful
disease  what a life pearl oysters must have if they feel like that

i ve heard pearls  is  a disease

then how horrid of you to let me have it  you ought to have told me

how could i  you were in such a hurry  i couldn t do anything  you were
just the same over that wretched mole  i do wish you wouldn t go off
like that again  you know you promised you wouldn t

i forgot  but it s the wishes that go off so quick

i say  where was your bracelet  dulcie  when you were an oyster

don t know   she answered  pondering   i s pose it must have melted  oh
yes  of course i remember  it had grown very small  and formed a sort of
little boundary all round me inside my shell  it s here all right now  i
can t think  let me see  what were we talking about before i went away
there was something i was going to tell you  what  were  we talking
about  cyril

sea serpents

oh yes  well  i was going to tell you  there must be sea serpents   cos
you remember it being in the papers and our seeing a picture of one

but that was all stuff and nonsense

no it wasn t

well  look here  we ll soon find out  little duffer  i wish i were a
sea serpent

i m not a duffer  after all   was dulcie s first thought as cyril
vanished into what looked like the end of a wriggling tail  a tail so
long that it stretched right out of view  and she realised this must be
part of her own brother  it was slowly moving away

don t go and leave me   she cried appealingly  clutching hold of the
great scaly thing  but it moved quicker  dragging her along  so  in her
anxiety she clambered on top of it  sat down  and found to her surprise
that its undulating movement of progress formed a regular switchback
and that she was travelling along its back towards its head in a most
pleasant and delightful manner

what a funny thing to happen   and she laughed   but whatever will
occur when i get to the end  and what yards and yards of him there seem
to be

all this she wondered and heaps more  till at last she saw the
creature s huge neck looming high up in front of her  when she got there
it stopped her progress  it turned its head round  which resembled that
of a giraffe  and its mild eyes looked kindly at her  and what was most
comic  yet comforting  it wore a nose ring of gold set with catseyes

illustration   what a glorious ride that was

she patted its neck affectionately  and then with a mighty glide of long
duration the huge creature took her up  up  until  with her still on its
back  gracefully reclining against its neck  the sea serpent arose with
her above the surface of the ocean

certainly  no one now would have taken them for twins

what a glorious ride that was  nothing around but the wild surging
spray  the wind blowing in her face  brightening her cheeks  and tossing
her fair hair about  above  the clouds  dark and heavy  tore
along  everywhere movement  reckless  turbulent movement

what a wild ride it was

far  far in the distance appeared a dark speck  as it came nearer it
turned out to be a ship with broken mast  broken by the waves which
leaped over its deck again and again  people were on it  for shouts came
from it borne along on the wind

a fearful squall arose as from the very bosom of the ocean  lightning
played around the doomed ship  half blinded by it  and bewildered by the
deafening noise of thunder  dulcie just caught a glimpse of the
fish king in the water near  before burying her face in her hands to
escape the blinding glare of the second flash  starting suddenly at the
terrifying clap of thunder that followed  she lost her balance and fell
off the sea serpent s back headlong into the surging waters  for some
time she was tossed about  sometimes swimming  sometimes floating
enjoying the excitement of the thing  knowing she couldn t drown  and
expecting every moment to see something of her huge brother  when all of
a sudden she found herself right in the middle of a shoal of fish

she was startled to find  too  that like them  she had been caught in a
large net from which  swim and search as she would  she could find no
means of escape  restlessly with her fellow captives she turned this way
and that in vain hope of freedom  she knew she must be adding to the
salt water around  for she felt so miserably helpless and lonely  and a
heavy sob now and again escaped her  here indeed was a lack of freedom
and no mistake  for the poor fish as well as for herself  never  never
again  she said to herself  would she beg for fish for tea if this was
what they had to endure  round and round inside the net she swam
backwards  forwards  upwards  downwards  no outlet was there  if only
she could find the way she got in  the thread was so hard and strong
too  that she could do nothing  tear at it with her little hands as she
would  she had nothing sharp about her either  not even a pin

the sea became calmer by degrees  but dulcie s anxiety grew  and her
impatience with it  till the sound of men s voices from above raised
her excitement to fever pitch

oh dear  oh dear  it must be the fisher people   and the thought that
the little swimming creatures darting about in terrified jerks would
soon be motionless for ever  helped to increase her distress

hold hard  bill  ain t it heavy   said a gruff voice

my missus won t be sorry   answered his mate

the net was actually being hauled up  and dulcie  beating against it
with her arms and struggling hard  was being hauled up with it

her sleeve had got rucked up  the catseyes glistened

i wish  oh what  i can t think  to be something very small indeed  oh
quick

no change occurred  she could now see the boat and the men s stooping
figures

oh please  i want to change  i want to be one of  no  i forgot  they
can t get out either  i wish i were a  a

holy st  patrick

bless me  what s that   exclaimed both men  glancing down at her

a periwinkle   gasped dulcie faintly

the next second the little girl disappeared from their view and the
fishermen rubbed their eyes and stared at one another with their mouths
open  the big fishes and little were quick to seize that golden
opportunity of their captors  careless handling of the net  and escaped
down to every jack sprat of them  and with the gentle murmur of the sea
there mingled noisy and ugly words of baffled hope and disappointment




chapter vi

the mystery of the crab


at the base of that cliff where the wild flowers grew  the golden sands
were still bathed in hot sunshine  and roughly caressed by the incoming
waves  upon the crest of one of these a periwinkle was borne  and
tossed  and flung  until it was landed high and wet on a soft bed of
seaweed  but not for long  for very soon a little girl arose from that
bed of seaweed  smoothed back her clinging hair  and cried out with joy
as she recognised her surroundings  it was dulcie  glad to be herself
once more  and on the same beautiful sands again  and her first thought
was of course for cyril

she was dripping wet  to wipe her face she took out her handkerchief
which of course was wet also  in order to dry it she tied it to a piece
of stick  thus it could serve as a flag  too  which she could wave to
attract cyril if he were about that coast  and show him where she was

remembering that  according to some wiseheads  sea water kindly gives no
chills  she had no fear for herself  so she lay down upon a patch of
nice warm pebbles  of which she took a handful  and began idly throwing
them one by one into the tide  which was running up to her feet faster
than it retreated at the ebbing of the waves

she was beginning to tire of this pastime when  plash  the last stone
she threw fell plump into a sandy pool  out of which there hurried an
enormous crab  dulcie was frightened  for the ugly creature had espied
his disturber and was coming towards her at a quick amble  sideways  she
turned and fled towards the cliff  and a turn of the head showed her
that her dreadful pursuer was not far behind  up the arduous steps she
climbed  stumbling every now and again in her hurry and
excitement  those steps down which she had tripped so gaily with her
brother  again she turned to look behind her  this time with a feeling
that here she must be safe

but the great crab was coming up the steps too  flushed and gasping  she
arrived at last on top of the cliff amongst the wild flowers once more

there  too  over the top appeared the terrifying creature  it was
seemingly quite fresh  and was gaining rapidly upon her  for now she was
quite tired out

she could run no more  so poor dulcie turned  and facing her pursuer
she cried

oh  please  please go away  oh  do  please

but the ugly crab never lessened its pace one bit  it came nearer and
nearer  so close that she could notice how it was shaking all over  and
how repulsive  till  till she saw that it was wearing something
glittering around its body  a band of gold with one last catseye and the
others all gone  it  must  be cyril  why didn t he change  dulcie
couldn t imagine  the creature stopped motionless  and tears were
dropping from its ugly eyes

what can be wrong   cried dulcie with a sob of horror and fear  but she
conquered her fear now that she was persuaded it was cyril  and she
approached still closer  she stroked it  actually stroked it  and
although it was just a great horrid crab the expression it wore was
heart rending

it s the wizard s trick   she exclaimed suddenly   poor cyril s last
catseye won t work   she never thought how many  she  still had  for she
was weeping bitterly over her brother in this dreadful guise  and she
could hardly wonder what the end would be  if this indeed were not the
horrible end of all

oh  cyril   she sobbed  addressing it   oh  cyril  how dreadfully
changed you are  whoever heard of having a crab for one s brother if
only we had remained twins all this never could have happened   and she
walked round and round it  wringing her hands in despair  but evidently
the poor quaking thing was powerless to give a shred of comfort  and its
whole appearance was helpless and hopeless in the extreme

it s no use stopping here like this   she decided at last   we d better
go on   and not quite thinking what she was doing  she whistled to it
as she whistled to towzer  and they moved slowly forward  dulcie
red eyed and dejected  and the crab following her at a side way amble

the strange pair had not proceeded far when dulcie musingly muttered

i wish i were a crab too  then of course i should know all that has
happened

strange to relate  she didn t turn into a crab  but remained a little
girl as usual  she might have sought the reason of this had not a sight
arrested her attention which caused her to run forward with a cry of
joy  it was the sudden appearance of the bird fairy  in whose
outstretched hand there glistened a jewel  a catseye  but how different
was its gleam to the one the poor crab wore   take it   she said
hurriedly in her pretty soft voice   and listen  i have wrested it from
the wizard  whose magnetic power succeeded in recovering one unused
though he had tried for several

illustration   she stroked it  actually stroked it

why did he do it   interrupted dulcie innocently

because he wanted to confuse me  and also to add one more to his
dreadful zoological collection  now replace the stone quickly and give
me the sham one  for it belongs to the red haired young lady  and is
stolen property

the child busily and anxiously obeyed her directions

stolen property   repeated dulcie in surprise

but the bird fairy had flown away and disappeared  the crab had
disappeared too  cyril stood before her  white and trembling  and the
next second his little sister was safe and snug in his arms

for some time the twins sat silent  huddled close together on the
variegated carpet of clover  and cowslips  and poppies  and bluebells

that  was  awful   exclaimed dulcie at last  cyril shivered

you saw the bird fairy  did you hear what she said

yes  i understood what she said  i s pose i understood  cos she s a
fairy

well  what do you think of it  cyril

i dunno  floors me completely  all i know is that i shouldn t like to
go through that scare again

it was very kind of her  wasn t it

the boy nodded thoughtfully and answered

yes  and i wonder why she did it

now dulcie thought of it  he looked quite dry  she felt his knees
according to her custom  after his being out in the rain  he certainly
was quite dry  she said how surprised she was that he should be so

how did you manage it after being in the pool   she asked

it must be running in the sun   he explained

it had done the same for her  and her serge frock was none the worse for
the sea water  by degrees they cheered up  they were so happy to be
together again on that lovely cliff  with the sea beyond sparkling so
cheerfully in the bright light as though it wanted to share in their
renewed gaiety

cyril   said dulcie   i m longing to hear what happened to you when we
were parted so suddenly in the ocean during that awful storm

all right   replied cyril promptly   when i looked round and found you
were not on my serpentine back  i didn t know where i was when you went
overboard  and therefore didn t know a bit where to search for you  i
changed into a crab so as to move about in a small space and more easily
for the purpose  i dodged the nets which were about  i had learned the
lesson we saw given during those sports

i wish i had paid more attention   sighed dulcie

and was washed ashore   continued her brother  not heeding the
interruption   right into that pool where stones came whizzing around
it was rather beastly  i m getting used to have stones shied at me  but
that last one was the best aimed  and caught me a good crack on the back
of my shell and nearly startled me out of it  it quite startled me out
of the water  at the same moment i caught a glimpse of your handkerchief
with the blue border  and of you racing off full pelt  i wished to
change to myself  nothing happened  i couldn t make it out  i wished
till i was red all over  still nothing  nothing  then i had an awful
feeling that it was hopeless and i was in the wizard s power

poor cyril

then i tore after you  shaking with fright as much as you were  i
thought you were too frightened to look at me  and that you d never do
so and never recognise me

but i did

and you saved me  dear little sis   cyril had grown quite pink in the
face  and was trying to keep back unmanly tears

did you  too  see the fish king during the storm   she interrupted  to
change the subject

yes  but he didn t get that ship he was after  for i stuck my huge self
between him and it  and switchbacked myself when he clung to me  like
one of those bucking horses  so he had no chance

did he recognise you  do you think

how could he  i didn t look much like the philosopher he knew

how about that ship

i was glad to see it right itself and drift away  the cries stopped
and the passengers pointed in my direction so excitedly

perhaps they were grateful   suggested his sister

or perhaps they thought it was i who had caused them to toss

but our host  it was scarcely fair to him

he didn t seem to mind  he simply dived down and disappeared

now  those people   said dulcie   if you saw them  they must have seen
you  and therefore   with a wise look   therefore they are sure to put
you in the newspapers

what a lark

and people who read about it are sure not to believe there was seen a
real live sea serpent  and wearing a nose ring  too  and then i s pose
they ll all be duffers  eh  cyril  and it ll be called the silly
season

dulcie laughed  and cyril laughed too  but something out at sea just
then caught his eye  he jumped up excitedly and began waving his arms
about frantically

look  look   he shouted

dulcie  kneeling by his side and shading her eyes with her hand  saw
that old clump of rocks again  and upon them stood his majesty the
fish king waving his crown at them  the tide rose higher and higher  he
made three low bows in their direction  dulcie fluttered her
handkerchief and curtsied  cyril bowed his best  the fish king made a
final gesture of farewell  the twins kissed their hands  his majesty put
his crown firmly on his head with a smack  and disappeared with the
rocks beneath the surging spray  and they felt they would never see him
more




chapter vii

the magic bracelets


how nice it is to be one s very own self again   observed dulcie
contentedly   i don t think i told you  cyril  that a star fish stared
so rudely at me and said something about  a winking  blinking  silly
periwinkle   which upset me very much at the time  but now it does seem
absurd   and she laughed  then she told of her escape from the net  and
cyril got very excited at her imprisonment within it  remarking it was a
jolly good thing  her  last catseye had proved all right or she would
have remained a periwinkle for ever

oh  cyril   she exclaimed  catching her breath   i never thought of
that  was it my last  that idea never came to me in the net  i never
thought at the time to see how many were left  why  wherever is my
bracelet

i say  where s mine   cried cyril

the magic bracelets were gone

the children looked at one another  aghast

i remember now   she exclaimed in awe struck tones   wishing to be a
crab so as to keep you company  and know the mystery  and i was too
miserable to think about the real wishes  and never noticed or thought
about not having changed  and oh  if  i  had happened to have one
catseye only   i  should have changed into a horrid crab and remained
one for really ever and ever

oh  bother  what s the good of going on like that  sis   said her
brother impatiently  for her voice verged very near a whimper   much
better smile and thank your stars you re only a girl  now what shall we
do  you suggest something  dulcie

go home   was her prompt reply  wistfully and not without anxiety

yes  but it s all very well to say  go home   the only way back must be
the way we came  and you know what that means  even if we can find it

from dulcie s looks she evidently didn t relish the prospect  the very
idea of the wizard made her tremble

i must say   continued her brother   i don t know how we re going to
manage it  we can t  so  he  said  cross the brook  and you could see he
meant it  so it s impossible  unless we roam about till we grow older
and then we shouldn t know the exact date when we leave off being
children under ten

we shouldn t know the date at all   said dulcie disconsolately   we
don t even know what time it is now

it feels like tea time   remarked cyril

oh no  the sun s too hot for that

let s go through our changes and see if we can make it all out   said
cyril   that s the first thing to do

they went carefully through their various experiences from the
beginning

i counted there were ten in each bracelet  so we ought each to have
five catseyes left  instead of none and no bracelets at all   he
concluded miserably  and they were both full of trouble  but soon
dulcie exclaimed

why  we  are  billies  we must count five more for getting back each
time into our own shapes

of course  there had been the mistake  and the fact being brought to
light proved a great relief

still   said cyril   we ought to have been more careful  and saved two
for the end  then we could have crossed the brook as animals or
something and taken our own shapes again on the other side  as we d made
up our minds to do

ah  but perhaps we shouldn t have had the power on the other side
remarked his sister

that was a new view of the case  the children were perplexed

anyway  we re in a nice fix   replied cyril

then they decided it was no use stopping there  especially as cyril
said he wanted his tea badly  so the only thing was to find their way
back  and try and dodge the wizard if they could  they wandered off  not
particularly hopeful  and very nervous  cyril thought he should know the
way once they found the bird fairy s glade  dulcie took his arm  and
they walked on in silence  which she broke at last

i wish some one would come and take care of us

i wish some one would bring me my tea   said her brother

i wish some one would come and tell us what to do   sighed dulcie  who
had begun to find out that it was of no use relying absolutely on cyril
any more   if only we were at home

i ll try to take you there  so cheer up  do   answered the boy
sturdily

the sea breezes were gone  the twins had reached the jungle  to give
themselves courage he whistled  rule britannia  and she hummed it  but
held his arm very tight  and every now and then looked furtively around
there was no sight or sound of anything living  nevertheless  they
hurried on  until they broke into a smart run  and ran  and ran     they
halted abruptly  cyril hadn t the slightest idea whereabouts they were
or which direction to take  it was no use asking dulcie if she
remembered  she only shook her head disconsolately  when they fled from
the jungle before  they had been far too scared to notice anything at
all in the way of landmarks

we ve got to get out of this and reach the town   observed the boy
thoughtfully   and then we ve got to get to the back of the cave

but  cyril  you ve forgotten that after the town comes the wood  and
then that horrid place

so i have  well  it s quite impossible  that s all  out and out
impossible   his face was growing very red

don t you remember  cyril  my saying how gloomy this place looked when
we entered it the first time  well  it looks gloomy enough here for
anything  so it may turn out all right  and after all  we may be near to
where we entered  come along  it really does seem brighter over there
the town may be quite close

it certainly was brighter beyond  but no streets were there  instead  to
their bewilderment  the little travellers found themselves already in
the daisy glade once more  they were positively in the beautiful wood
again  the first object that caught their eye was something white  it
was cyril s lost handkerchief which dulcie picked up  it was a brand new
one  and tucked it in his pocket at once

i say  isn t it curious how i ve brought you back so easily   remarked
her brother

it must be some short cut you found  by accident   replied his sister
decisively  and that settled that  in the absolute silence which had
reigned around  a peculiar rustling now attracted their attention
dulcie hung back  and cyril held her hand as he advanced cautiously
they came to a sudden standstill as  from a clump of trees  a tall
figure in a yellow satin gown emerged and confronted them

pray walk in   said the wizard  and taking the boy and girl by a hand
he led them  not through the wood and along the country road  but
somehow straight through the back entrance into his cave dwelling

i m so pleased to see you again   remarked their host  smiling as he
took off his spectacles and scratched his nose with them   i see you ve
not found freedom yet  ha  ha  pray make yourselves quite at home

out of his satchel he drew forth the two bracelets in which were no
catseyes

used them quite all  i see   he remarked blandly   these others  poor
things  thought they could change back the other side of my domain   and
the wizard laughed most unpleasantly loud  just like his knocker

please  sir   ventured dulcie coaxingly after his hilarity was
over   please  sir  do let us go home

but your brother  i m sure he wouldn t be satisfied

indeed i would   said cyril

tush  nonsense   exclaimed the wizard    i  never say  don t  here  so
you are going to live with me and be oh so happy and free  free to do
everything i tell you  you would have been more useful as a crab  but
now you shall  both  tend my little zoological collection  they are not
always so still  oh no  you shall help me do my tricks  you shall help
me ruin that fishy old king  and help me keep that bird fairy in order
till she shall rue the day that she ever tried to

the twins heard no more  locked in one another s arms they had suddenly
sunk down in placid slumber  the astonished wizard stopped in his flow
of eloquence  he walked round and round them  his face grew blacker and
blacker  whilst the twins slept calmly on  dulcie s head resting
peacefully on cyril s shoulder

well i m blessed   muttered the wizard   or should be if i weren t
so

chapter viii

the spell  and how it worked


the poor children felt as though they had come under some gentle
influence  and curiously enough  though outwardly asleep  they were
conscious of the wizard walking around them  pushing and pinching them
which somehow they never felt  and they were conscious  too  that he was
troubled about something  what it was they couldn t imagine  he began to
mutter threats coupled with the name of the bird fairy

the wizard was clearly not at all happy  indeed  he was profoundly
concerned  for every time he touched the children to wake them  a
sensation of cold spread over his hands which became rapidly more and
more acute until it felt like touching fire  and he shrank back
muttering and grumbling

at that moment there was a great rush of air  the bird fairy appeared
and with outspread wings she stood over the resting children  and  full
of pity  she gazed down at them  then they knew they were in her care
and they knew  too  that  they knew something which might prove useful
and precious   and they smiled happily as they lay there

what do you want here   demanded the wizard harshly   how dare you come
here and try to thwart me

i have come to pray you to turn from your evil ways  let these poor
children go   begged the bird fairy in tones sweet and pleading   they
have realised how much their happy home means to them and the safety
there is in being taken care of  let them go back to it

tush  nonsense  what s all that to me  begone while i let you  i m in
no mood to be trifled with

show kindness and mercy for once   was her reply

what  go  you remain to mock me  remember my little zoological
collection  which of us triumphed throughout

don t boast of that

but there is much to boast about  and my experiments have not stood
still since that remote period  science has progressed

you will not be merciful

a scornful laugh was all the reply he vouchsafed

then know   she continued solemnly   that our fairy enchantments have
also strengthened with time

is it to be another tussle between us   inquired the wizard  smiling

it is  and i pray it may be for the last time  i have failed before
but this time i am going to succeed  with the girl my difficulty was not
so great  but the boy has been hard to convince that other creatures
have troubles greater than his  others have returned to you through your
craft  but this little couple you were forced to go and meet  you sought
to entrap the boy as a crab  it was i who restored the gem and saved
him  as you may have guessed  and with that success the bird fairy s
hour now has come  you have failed to snare them as bird  beast  or
fish  your science can change mortals to nothing else  and now you shall
fail to turn them to slaves

again the wizard s discordant laughter was heard  and he said

you certainly got hold of that gem  my dear  and you evidently consider
yourself in consequence an apt pupil of that old fairy who befriended
you  worse luck to her  had she but passed a moment later there would
have been no time to frustrate me  my science would have been powerful
enough to change you into a mere bird  my collection would have been the
more valuable  and she could not have made you into a fairy besides  nor
would you have known enchanting arts with power to torment me  nor would
you have had any hope of future freedom

the wizard paused a moment  then rasped out

were it not for your own salvation perhaps you wouldn t be so ready to
help the children  and to dare attempt to triumph over me  but we shall
see what progress we have both made

we shall see   she repeated   touch these dear children if you can  you
find it difficult  you do not understand it  eh

the wizard  with a groan of pain  had leapt back after another attempt

i soon shall understand it   he cried angrily  taking up a bottle
containing a green fluid  a few drops of which he poured into his
palms  then smiled   this will wake them quickly enough  and probably
never let them sleep again

but the only result was a louder cry of pain from him and a peaceful
snore from them

the bird fairy looked steadily at him  and the wizard trembled with
anger and fear  recovering himself he muttered   you ve got them well
under your wing  so it must be with you i have to deal first  ah  ha
i ll show you how science can outdo your paltry old fashioned arts

thereupon he took a curious box shaped mechanism  pointed it at the
bird fairy  pressed a spring  and instantly the pretty trio became
enveloped in a halo of rainbow  the next moment the wings of the
bird fairy drooped  and the children awoke  her spell was broken

he moved his terrible invention slightly  so that she alone was
encircled by the rainbow ray  she stood there motionless like a
beautiful statue  and the bird fairy was in the wizard s power

illustration   the wizard  with a groan of pain  had leapt back

a few moments more and his triumph would be supreme and everlasting  she
would exist no more  his evil heart thumped with excitement and glee

a continuous and regular movement around the cave  and an underground
heaving and low  distant rumbling arrested the wizard s attention  he
gasped and started  and the instrument he held fell from his grasp and
shivered to atoms

the twins were the cause  it was they who had started the commotion
unobserved by the wizard in his moment of exultation  freed by him from
the bird fairy s spell  they were free to follow the irresistible
inclination they felt when they were under it  so they gently stroked
each of the animals around  and were charmed to find that as they did so
each poor creature changed to girl or boy and vanished from its prison
whilst the ground trembled and the rumbling became louder and louder  as
though some unseen power was helping in the rescue  so quickly did they
run round on their task that at the moment when the wizard realised his
mishap  just as he thought he had triumphed  dulcie and cyril had done
their work  they started as they saw the wizard lying full length on the
ground next to his shattered invention  the rays of which were let loose
and playing like lightning all round him

then they remained rooted to the spot with amazement  for just beyond
was the bird fairy  who before their astonished gaze became suddenly
bereft of her wings and covering of feathers  and now stood before them
as a lovely princess  in draperies of silver tissue  and with a golden
circlet upon her dark hair  a happy smile was on her face  as with a
farewell gesture she motioned the children away

illustration   lying full length on the ground next to his shattered
invention

there was a terrific noise as of a thunder clap  they looked back
nothing but a dark cloud was there



come quick   cried dulcie  taking cyril s hand and running off with
him   there s no shelter here  let s get in before the rain

and away they sped from the rocks on which they had so often played
reached home  ran indoors  and got upstairs just before the big drops
turned into a heavy downpour and came pattering against the nursery
window pane

are you children ready   called up their mother in her kind  cheery
voice   come down and have tea with me for a treat

it was a welcome invitation  they were quick to shout their thanks and
to make themselves tidy  when they entered the parlour  where the sun
was peeping in again after his absence  their mother said quietly

i m glad you ve escaped the storm

later on  they all three sat in the gathering twilight at the large
bow window watching nature going to sleep  the two children sat up very
late that night  and they told their mother such an extraordinary story
that she wondered how ever it could have got into their heads  and
wondered where they could have read it  but they knew they hadn t read
it

look at the bump on cyril s forehead   exclaimed dulcie  as conclusive
evidence of the fight  but their mother only shook her head  cyril often
wore such marks of battle

and  little mother  we  are  so glad to be at home   she laughed  but
they meant it




the old fangled father and his new fangled sons


centuries ago  an old father  as old as one of them  lay on his couch
feeling that his end was near  he was not surprised  in fact  he had
foreseen it as he had foreseen many other events  and he was reputed
wise beyond his years  and therefore far beyond those of the people who
reputed it

so he called softly to him his three sons  they didn t hear him  being
busy in different parts of the house  and it never occurred to him to
ring the bell  because he was so old fangled  he shouted to them  and
they came

i have three things to say to you   remarked the father solemnly

the sons fidgeted visibly  they had been studying  were not at home to
any one  and particularly had not wished to be disturbed in their work
they thought that their father was going to begin another anecdote  and
it put them out of humour  but they were startled when he said

my sons  my end is near

each one replied with an endearing term  just one  for they were not men
of many words  and they told him  it was only his fuss   that he was
only a hundred  and didn t look as if he were going to be cut off
prematurely    that he mustn t give in and should never say  die

i cannot argue the point   replied the old man   let me tell you my
last wishes as briefly as i can  for my time is short

they tried to dissuade him from talking so much  but it was of no avail
for he protested that it was their duty to listen to him  and he
insisted upon having last wishes as he had read that others had had
before him  and it would be for the sons to obey and unravel them as
best they could

then the father  addressing the eldest  who was ambitious and already
past middle age  spoke as follows

my son  my first born  find out the furthermost summit of the world
and when you have surmounted that  you can surmount anything

to his second son  who was avaricious and also getting old and rather
bald  he said

sit patiently  and wait  and when you can hear a voice that comes from
no living throat  and can see its traces  you will want for nothing

to the third son  and consequently his favourite  who was romantic
being better looking and naturally younger than his elder brothers  the
father spoke thus

you  my son  who are the pride of my heart  the joy of my life  the
light of mine eyes  search the atmosphere till at your bidding it
showers down burning stars  then shall you go to the beautiful princess
who awaits you  and live without labour

and the three brothers murmured under their breath

poor old dad  he s certainly very unwell

but he had not yet finished

try to realise your ambition  my sons   he continued   i have shown you
the ways you should go  then  and only then  will you have earned that
priceless jewel  contentment

the old man then composed himself comfortably  and died a few years
later  after a sharp attack of senile decay  leaving many regrets and
unsettled accounts behind him

when that happened the three sons were very sad all day and all night
the very next morning they called to mind his last wishes of a few years
ago  and decided to ponder over them  give them the benefit of their
doubt  and see if anything could be made out of them  and they stuck
manfully to their resolution  especially as the creditors were hourly
expected

the eldest son looked up all the maps and geography books he could get
hold of  and studied them until he came to the uncomfortable conclusion
that he would certainly risk death by sea and cannibals many times
before he could hope to reach the furthermost summit of the globe

the second son sat and waited for the voice he was both to hear and
trace  until at night he gave up in despair  so he decided that the only
voice worth listening to was that of common sense

the favourite son  meanwhile  went for a long walk  bent on success
and  unlike the others  full of a new hope  yet  search as he would  he
could find no spot where the atmosphere changed into stars at his
bidding  and he returned home long after dinner time disconsolate to his
supper of soup which had grown cold

the next morning the three brothers arose in disappointment and vexation
of mind  they murmured loud and long at having been sent on fairy tale
errands in a world where no clever talking animals really existed  or
kind hearted inanimate objects volunteered to befriend them on
impossible quests

as the first born explained

if i were to coax my parrot and ask him to help me in return for my
many years of kindness  as they do successfully in fairy stories  he
would bite me for my pains  as he always does whenever i feed him

and the second born said

if i were to fondle a pin and said   ah  pin  canst thou help me in my
distress   ten to one i would get pricked  and serve me right for being
so imbecile

as for me   exclaimed the romantic one   were a gentle wolf to find me
mooning about the forest thinking of my beauteous princess  surely would
he stop and  with a keen sense of the fitness of things  he would not
trifle with politeness  but he would eat of me as much as would satisfy
his present need  perhaps even more than he could digest

and the brothers laughed aloud in the splenetic bitterness of their
three souls

another year went by  the sons had paid their father s debts and made
some on their own account  so they held a council  and they confessed
that they had idled so long because they were haunted by the rosy
promise their father s words held out  and  do what they would  they
could neither forget them nor yet find any solution

then together they pondered and thought  until one fine day  all the
rest about that time had been wet  they concluded that as they were not
believers in fairy tales  science perhaps might help them

so they worked and worked and worked  each with his own object  they
certainly did not lack brains  or test tubes  or electric wire  yet just
as certainly did they lack money  and  but for the occasional doing of
menial work  they would have starved and starved and gone hungry

at last the eldest son solved his mystery  now could he surmount the
furthest summit of the world  for he had invented a machine which could
carry him soaring like a bird over mountains and over seas

and the second son solved  his  mystery  now he could hear a voice that
came from no living throat and yet could see its traces  for he had
invented an automaton that could speak and could record its words with a
stylus upon tablets of wax

and the third son solved  his  mystery  he had searched the atmosphere
and now at his bidding burning stars were showered down  for he had
invented a kite fashioned on a wonderful wire  which went through the
air and drew forth electric sparks  and his heart burned with love for
the beautiful princess whom he knew awaited him  though by this time she
must be getting on

the excitement of the brothers was great   it is our genius we can
thank   they exclaimed all in three breaths   our father  steeped in his
old fangled lore  never could have foreseen our triumphs  he never could
have guessed how we should solve his posers   that was their conclusion
then they shook hands all round  congratulated one another  and went
their different ways

the eldest flew off  mounted upon his wonderful air steed  amid the
gaping of the astonished villagers  and his two brothers looked after
him wistfully until he disappeared far away behind the clouds  the hopes
of the traveller rose ever higher and higher as for weeks and months he
soared on  exhilarated beyond all imagination  at last he came to the
furthermost summit of which his dear father had spoken so solemnly  over
it sailed the son as easily as a bird  when crack  the machine broke and
collapsed  and the unfortunate inventor was hurled headlong into the
sea  and every moment threatened to be his last  but wasn t  as he
floundered in the water he looked annoyed  and he murmured to himself

there must be some mistake  who can truly say that i have found
contentment here

meanwhile the second son had borrowed a camel and gone off with his
precious automaton to the great city  there to reap the reward of his
labours  all the way he reckoned how he could best enjoy the vast sums
of gold which would be poured into his lap  and he came to the
conclusion that to gaze at it would give more pleasure than to spend any
of it  except just a little for coffers to keep it in  he laughed aloud
in anticipation  arrived at his journey s end  he unpacked his treasure
and set it working  and was forthwith lodged in prison  for the city
turned out to be as narrow minded as it was great  and it assured him
that he must be a wizard  he assured it he wasn t  and proved that he
didn t believe in fairy tales  for he had not relied upon them for help
but it was of no avail  there was nothing more to be said  this
disappointing ending to so much effort and such real success encouraged
him in the conviction that in the position in which he found himself he
could find no legitimate ground for contentment

during this time the favourite son had sallied forth singing in search
of the beauteous princess  his marvellous kite was slung behind him  he
wended his steps toward the only court he knew of  where dwelt a
princess good  beautiful  and unmarried  a combination of charms of
marked rarity  so joyous and merry was he  that the squirrels squeaked
and scurried away at sight of him  and the very hyenas laughed in
harmony as he passed by singing   tra la la   in his blithe
lightsomeness  ah  how gladsome and thrice happy was that merry  merry
morn

now the princess sat in the vast hall of the palace turning up her nose
at the stream of suitors that promenaded in front of her  very bored and
weary at the continuous routine  but she never seemed to tire of it in
her certainty that  the right one  would put in his appearance at the
right moment

she was a very spoilt lady indeed  there was no one to gainsay her
indeed  so spoilt was she  that every night she would cry for the stars
and blame the skies for being selfish and not sparing her a few when
they knew  for she had often told them  that she wished to wear them in
her hair  and every one said how illogical it was of her  and no one
told her they were too large for practical purposes

one bitterly cold night  whilst she was sitting thus at her open
casement  bemoaning the selfishness of the skies  and heedless of
everything else  a mighty hubbub arose outside

what ho   called the pretty princess  her attendants came tumbling in
to her in their eagerness to answer her summons

what s without   she inquired

nobody knew  and tumbled out to get to know  they rushed back and told
her all at once that a brand new suitor had arrived at that unusual
hour  and would she snub him at once or tarry till the morrow  it took
her a little time to unravel what was said amidst such a babel of
voices

la  oh my   suddenly exclaimed the princess  her eyes riveted outside
on the blackness of the night  she could scarcely believe her senses
for there  in her garden  stars were actually falling down in showers
lighting up the figure of a man who  with upstretched hand  was
beckoning them to come

he was summoned at once to the royal presence  shivering and blue with
cold  but his romantic heart throbbed at the sight of so much beauty
and his face assumed a warmer hue  he was so intoxicated with delight
that afterwards he could never quite tell how it all came about  as in a
haze  he remembered the princess greeting him as the one long awaited
he recollected her saying that as he could wrest the stars from the
selfish skies  he could gratify her desire to wear some in her hair  and
bade him go collect them

he explained his invention  she grew impatient  he told her the
electricity would kill him  she shrugged her shoulders and insisted  he
declined to take the risk  whereupon she turned into a fury in her
pretty illogicality  and exclaiming that he must be the wrong man after
all  she flung his invention into the fire and ordered him to be flung
after it  he took the hint by the heels and fled through the window  far
into the night

not at all content with his romantic adventure  or with life as a whole
he enlisted and became a target in the front rank of the army

it was  of course  some time later that the eldest brother  who had been
plucked from the billows by a fisherman who happened to be passing by as
usual  booked his passage home  and found on his arrival that the said
home had been sold  as advertised  for building lots in eligible plots
on easy terms  to pay expenses

the second brother  in order to secure his freedom from prison  then and
there smashed up his automaton and trudged home  arriving just in time
to join his brother in being ordered away from their former doorstep
though still held responsible for the rates and taxes

at that moment  too  the brother of the twain was deposited amongst
them  having been invalided to his sold up home for life

so  in order not to trespass for fear of prosecution  they all three sat
down a little outside the boundary line and recounted each to the others
their adventures and their experiences  it was nightfall before they had
done  and they really could hardly help laughing  and then  after
thinking things out  they shook hands all round in silence

for the prophecy had come true   they were content   the three sons were
now thoroughly content  to work no more  to do nothing more for the rest
of their existence  it wasn t worth it  they said  their disappointments
were over  and they were fully content that they should be so  the
villagers  once more open mouthed in their gaping  and open minded too
differed from the inhabitants of the great city  and looked upon the
brothers as who should say  three wise men   and took upon themselves
the care of them in the workhouse  and were proud to get them  and to
show them to visitors

as to the beautiful princess  she was changed by time into an old maid
and still kept on turning up her nose at elderly  rheumatic suitors as
they passed on their usual rounds

so the old father was right after all

his ambitious son had surmounted everything  including disappointment

his avaricious son had succeeded in having his wants supplied for
nothing

and his favourite son could jog along as romantically as the workhouse
rules allowed  without labour and without effort




the little picture girl


it was christmas eve  and a little girl lay in her little bed  wondering
what santa claus was going to put in her stocking this year  it was hung
up where he would be sure to see it  and upon the same chair before the
fireplace she had thoughtfully placed her clothes brush in case he might
like to brush off the soot from his coat

the grate held but a few smouldering embers  for it was late  very
late  at least ten o clock  and minna ought to have been asleep hours
ago  perhaps she would have been  only there were so many things to
wonder about to night  and one cannot be sure of wondering about them
when one is fast asleep

so after wondering about santa claus  she turned to the stars  which she
could see through the uncurtained window  she wondered if they twinkled
and winked like that because they liked it or because she liked it  then
there was the moon  which was looking straight at her in its own
unblushing  beaming way and filled the room with its light  and she sat
up in bed and watched it  wondering where it went to during the day

now opposite her bed were three pictures  coloured and framed  one was
of a dainty columbine smiling at her companion picture  a harlequin who
stood on his toes with feet crossed  and his arms folded over his staff
and the pair set her wondering what she would see at the promised
pantomime

between them hung minna s favourite picture  it represented a fine old
moated house covered with snow  on the white path which led from the
portico were tracks of little feet  manifestly made by the little
smiling girl who stood in the act of passing over the bridge that
spanned the moat  she appeared to be the same age as minna  about six
years old  and was dressed in a red pelisse and fur tippet  her dark
hair peeped from under a red  broad brimmed hat with drooping feathers
and her hands were hidden in a large fur muff

minna herself had just such an outdoor costume  and when dressed for her
walk she had often wondered where the little picture girl could be
going so gaily for hers  and now minna wondered that once more as she
glanced at her favourite picture  upon which the moon was shining so
brightly to night  till  bathed in the bright light  it seemed to stand
right out from the shadows of the room

illustration   the little picture girl

there was a creak  as though the old wardrobe wanted to stretch itself
after standing still so long  a funny little way furniture has now and
again  but minna didn t think it was the wardrobe this time  she thought
harlequin had done it  for it seemed to her as though he had suddenly
stretched forth his arm and struck out with his staff  no  he was just
as usual  only somewhat darker  being in shadow  and as usual just ready
to do something  yet never doing it

but surely with the favourite picture there was something
different   some change  it was always morning there  and now  why  now
it was night  the moon was lighting up the old moated house  and the
stars were twinkling over its heavy  white capped roof  minna looked for
the little girl in red  but there was no little girl in red on the
bridge at all

of course   reflected minna   she must be in bed behind one of those
little dormer windows fast asleep  for it must be very late

this seemed strange somehow  yet it was only just as it really ought to
be  she herself never went for a morning walk in the middle of the
night  nor had she ever heard of any one else doing so

all at once  from the distant steeple which peeped through the white
sparkling trees beyond the bridge  came a muffled striking of the hour
and minna  to her increasing surprise  counted on her fingers up to ten
and then there were two more  and then  to her amazement  whom should
she see on the bridge in the snow  which had begun gently to fall
again  not the little girl in red  but dear old santa claus himself
covered up in fur and scarlet  trudging towards the house with
tempting looking parcels slung about him  now he fixed a ladder against
the thick  frost laden ivy which covered the front of the old house  and
he mounted it very carefully  then he climbed up the roof as easily as
if he had been walking along the high road in the daylight  and then he
disappeared down one of the chimneys  very soon he reappeared without
quite so many parcels  slowly descended the ladder  put it upon his
shoulder  and walked off with it

minna s eyes followed him with the utmost astonishment and interest  of
course  she always knew that it was santa claus s lovely privilege to
come down the chimney  but she had never actually known him to do
it  and then the joy of seeing him come out again  evidently on his
rounds  was breathlessly delicious

illustration   he mounted it very carefully

all was quiet now  only the moon and the stars and minna watching over
the slumbering house and garden  about which the soft snow flakes
hovered and fluttered  she had more than ever to wonder about now  she
longed for a peep  just one peep  inside that beautiful house  to see if
the little picture girl was really asleep

harlequin must have guessed what minna wanted  for there is no doubt
that he gave her a knowing look  though it might have been meant for
sweet columbine   and just as surely minna saw his arm stretch out and
heard the rap of his staff upon the picture frame  then he pretended he
hadn t done it  but she forgot all about him  so great was her interest
in what she saw

at that touch of harlequin s the scene had changed to a dainty bedroom
it was dawn  a red pelisse and hat hung upon a peg on the door  and a
large muff peeped from its box on the shelf  a rosy light tinged the
face of the child who was sleeping there in the old wooden bedstead  and
woke her up  the first thing the little picture girl did was to look
with content into her stocking  it was very fat  and then  with a little
pant of delight  she discovered a lovely doll lying on her pillow  first
she hugged and then she kissed it  then she laid her new treasure beside
her  her heavy eyelids drooped  and she fell asleep again

and nothing stirred

more  please   said minna  by this time quite at home with harlequin
again he gave that knowing look  and did as she asked  a rap  and once
more she saw the garden  it had stopped snowing  and the sun was rising
over the old roof

suddenly a little sweep appeared  swung himself up by the ivy  crept
stealthily up the tiles  and disappeared down a chimney  in a moment he
reappeared with a doll and a fat looking stocking  all so quickly that
before minna had time to clasp her hands and cry out  he was gone
altogether  she looked at harlequin  but he paid no attention

more   she repeated eagerly  harlequin s staff then moved and rapped

and there was the breakfast room in the old moated house  the master of
it sat at the table reading his newspaper  soon he looked up and nodded
encouragingly at his little daughter  who very seriously was making his
tea  she nodded back and smiled  but it was a sad little smile  and her
eyes were rather red  as though something had happened

then the door opened  and  to every one s surprise  in marched a stout
beadle  in one hand he held a doll and a stocking full of sweets  and in
the other he held the collar of a little sweep  with the little sweep
wriggling inside it  close behind there came a tiny crippled girl  who
moved painfully by the aid of a crutch to the boy s side  and laid a
trembling hand on his arm  the brother and sister were much like one
another  in feature and in squalor  great tears were rolling down her
cheeks  and her poor face was no whiter with pain than his with fright
beneath the soot  though  looking lovingly at her  he tried to appear
brave

the beadle noticed the little picture girl s look of recognition at
sight of her lost treasures  and as he gave them back to her he pointed
to the black marks on the doll s frock  which tallied with the little
sweep s grimy paw  and then jerked his head towards the crippled child
in whose possession he had found them  then the stout beadle gave the
boy a shake  just to remind him of his wrong doing  as if any further
reminder was needed   and made for the door  dragging the wretched
offender after him

but the little picture girl showed so much distress  stopped him  and
looked at him so piteously  and with so much kindness in her sweet eyes
that he let go his grip of the collar  then she put the presents into
the boy s hand  and pushed him gently towards his sister  but the lad
shook his head sadly  and looked more ashamed than ever

illustration   in marched a stout beadle

the little picture girl glanced at her father  who had been silently
watching the scene  he nodded  so she pressed them on the boy  whose
eyes now filled with tears as he gazed  humbled and grateful  at the
beautiful young lady whose generosity saved him from punishment
meanwhile  the gentleman christmas boxed the beadle  who smiled fatly
and went his way  then  for a moment or two  the picture father s
uplifted finger wagged a warning at the boy  who hung his head  but
minna could see that it was not so very terrible  because  if the boy
had not confessed his fault  how would the beadle have known in what
house he had yielded to temptation for his sister s sake  the little
cripple dried her eyes at seeing her brother safe  and was very grateful
for the gifts she hesitated to accept  but she had a right to keep them
now  and it was not her fault that she was the innocent cause of her
brother s offence

food from the breakfast table was wrapped up in the newspaper  the big
bundle was put into the little sweep s arms  and the two poor waifs who
had entered so miserable were sent away happy at the bright moment which
had entered into their dark lives  whilst the little picture girl  who
for the second time had lost the presents santa claus had brought her
looked after the poor little pair quite content  and smiled as she
waved good bye with her pretty hand

then the master of the old moated house wiped his spectacles  which
somehow had become quite misty  he lifted up his little daughter in his
arms and kissed her  and  putting his hand into his pocket  drew from
his purse a gold piece which she took with a laugh of surprise and
delight  and threw her arms round his dear bronzed neck

minna saw nothing more  she must have fallen fast asleep

it was very late when she awoke  the first thing she did was to smile as
she trotted off to look at what santa claus had put in her stocking  she
had seen him on his rounds  she had seen his parcels  dear  kind old
santa claus  who saves up all the year to be the loving  generous friend
to little children at christmas time  minna smiled again as the thought
flashed through her mind  she approached her stocking  it looked rather
thin  horridly thin  it was empty  she ran to her pillow  nothing on it
nothing under it  she could not understand it  oh  santa claus

she gave a big gulp  and decided to wait and see what her father would
say about it  she had to bustle too  for the bell would very soon ring
for breakfast  at which it was her duty to preside

papa  santa claus has forgotten me   were her first words after the
morning kiss

illustration   smiled as she waved good bye

at this  her father pursed up his lips with a blank look   dear  dear
good gracious   pon my word  what a forgetful old santa claus  i m
afraid he s getting past his work  perhaps   he said  turning to the
window  as a tear was gathering in each of minna s bright eyes   the
snow was too thick

no  funnyums   she often called him that    it wasn t the snow  i know
he was out in it   cos i saw him

saw him  did you   he replied  smiling   well  perhaps he gave all the
toys away till there were none left  and then  as the shops were shut
there were no more to be had

minna now felt sure her father was joking as usual  and that there must
be some secret

but perhaps  minna  santa claus came to my room by mistake   he added
in fact  it occurred to me that he might  he s getting short sighted
you know  and  we are so very much alike  suppose you go and see

away she ran  and there  sure enough  were funnyums s two socks hung up
one looked full  the other looked empty  she found in the full one all
sorts of good things to eat  minna emptied it quickly

i wish funnyums wore stockings   she murmured  then she went to the
empty one  which wasn t empty  because right down in the toe there was a
gold piece

then funnyums was hugged  and funnyums was thanked  and scolded for
being up to his tricks again  and then hugged once more to make it all
right  all that stirring time he was quietly pretending to read his
newspaper  just as though he really wanted to read it at all

and minna forgot everything in the excitement of christmas day  that
night she slept soundly  the following day she went to the pantomime
and afterwards dreamt about columbine

it was only on the morrow that she noticed again her favourite picture
and then her mind wandered back to the wonderful things that had
happened there  and as she gazed at the little girl in red  who was
going out so joyously for her morning walk  it occurred to her where the
little picture girl must be going to  she was going out  as minna was
to spend the gold piece  her  father had given her

ah  she deserved it   minna said to herself   i  i don t quite think
i ve deserved mine  that is  quite so much  i should like to do
something for children who suffer and are poor   she muttered
like  like the children in the hospital   and slowly  as she thought it
out  she made up her mind that the doll she was going to buy should be a
very small one  and that the rest of the money from the gold piece she
would send to the  children s hospital fund

seldom has any child felt happier than minna did that sunny morning as
she donned her red pelisse and hat  and took her muff from its box  she
paused at the door  and glanced at the little picture girl  who was
smiling back at her   a merry christmas and a happy new year   said
minna out loud  dropped her a little curtsey  nodded gaily  and ran
out




the sleeping beauty s dream

she pricked her hand with the point of the spindle  and fell
into a deep  deep sleep


and the creepers that had been climbing over the castle walls for a long
time  searching for the turret chamber wherein the sleeping princess
lay  the ivy  the jessamine  the briar rose  climbed round odd niches
and corners  as if all were curious to see the lovely maiden under the
fairy spell  but the years went by and none had reached so high  though
one sweet little briar rose had not given up hope  and crept steadily
onward and spread as it went  and this is the dream of the beautiful
princess

she dreamt that she arose and wandered forth out of the castle gates  on
to the sunlit terrace  her attendants had dozed over their labours  and
she wondered at their laziness  the peacocks had stopped in their
strutting and had fallen asleep  even the singing birds in the trees had
ceased their trilling and hidden their little heads under their wings
but the princess did not tarry  she went straight on  past the closed up
daisies and sunflowers and the drooping foxgloves  past the goldfish
drowsing in the fountain basin  for all around nature was hushed and had
fallen asleep

without hesitation she crossed the meadow of wild flowers  and reached
the willow path that skirted the sparkling river  and did not stop until
she reached a willow larger than the rest  then  bending under its
branches  she neared the water s edge  there an old wooden skiff was
moored  lifting her silken robe  she stepped into it  unfastened the
cord  and  reclining on the embroidered cushions  she closed her eyes
with a happy sigh  away drifted the bark with its lovely burden  the
sunlight turned to twilight with lurid gleams  and pale green flecks
jewelled the sky  the twilight turned to dark grey and silver  and the
moon and stars watched her on her way  the bark floated to where the
silent river joined the open sea  still peacefully on it went  over the
bosom of the moonlit ocean  onward into the night

the princess s sweet thoughts were disturbed by the sudden stopping of
her craft  which had run aground on the sands just where the tiny
wavelets retreated shyly  to venture again and as quickly withdraw

soft and balmy was the summer s night  and on the breeze music came
wafted towards the young princess  who smiled and landed lightly  drawn
by the bright strains which led her  following  to a pleasure ground
lights hung festooned in the great trees  and in an open space peasants
in their picturesque costumes were dancing  and laughing as they
stepped  the princess  from behind a tree  gazed on the scene  on the
glades and lake in the distance  all mysterious in the night  and as she
listened to the laughter and the music  she knew she had never heard
anything so delightful before

happy at the sight and sounds  she moved from behind the tree  and she
saw a young man approach her with great respect  one of a group who were
not dancing  the princess would have fled  but he was already close  and
although his dress betokened origin as humble as that of those around
he was as handsome as a young god  they looked into one another s eyes
then she accepted his invitation to dance

afterwards they sat together on a mossy knoll and talked low  all was
silent around  and the light of the stars was reflected in the
glow worms  but the princess did not tell him who she was  and when he
spoke of a quest on which he was about to start  to find his unknown
betrothed  who awaited him in a distant land  she wept  her sweet tears
fell upon his hand  which he raised to his lips and reverently kissed
them there  and she smiled on him for doing so  but the smile faded as
an old woman came  and  plucking him by the sleeve  told him it was the
hour to go  and when the princess was alone she felt as though she had
never known before what it was to be alone

and she would be awakened by a king s son

how long a time passed by she did not know  but again she saw the
handsome peasant youth  and her heart sank as she thought that her
release could come only through the kiss of some king s son who could
claim her for his wife  then she pondered no more  for she saw the
traveller now  far  far away  where she could not get near him  and he
was in a forest path  wrestling with desperate fury with a giant who had
barred the way

breathlessly she watched the youth as he struggled in the brawny
monster s clutch  the princess  moved by his stress  cried out in her
sleep  then the rays of the noonday sun  redoubling their forceful heat
shone forth with overpowering energy  the giant  struck with the pain of
it  clasped his hands to his head  and fell backwards like a log to the
ground

the princess knew that her love was safe  and by her fear for his
safety she knew  too  how dear he was to her  and she went on
dreaming  dreaming happily of what might be the future shared with one
she loved so much

her heart fluttered as with foreboding of evil  she beheld a range of
mountains  and up the foot of one of the peaks a peasant youth toiled
his weary course  but the mountain was so slippery that his efforts were
of no avail  as he gazed round she could see the handsome features
clouded by fatigue that almost was despair  she saw that the mountain
was glistening  and that it was made of ice

then she felt the breath of summer  she saw it lift the white pall from
the earth  she saw it melt the belt of ice  and as she looked the
mountain dissolved into water under the warmth of her love  she saw that
he was safe  trudging over the carpet of cowslips  smiling as he went
she wanted to run towards him  but he passed through a thicket and
disappeared from sight

the princess arose to follow him  but she lost her way  and wandered on
and on through a dense forest  where nothing stirred but scampering
hares and startled squirrels

at last  towards evening  she came to a path all gay with glowing
flowers  refreshed by their evening bath of dew  and whispering to one
another a hushed good night ere closing their eyes to the light  as the
princess passed along  the strains of an organ fell upon her ear  and
she saw a great temple before her  she stood at the open door  within
hundreds of candles lighted the vast grey dome  and far beyond  in a
haze of mystery  stood the man she loved  and by his side his bride  all
veiled in white  and she knew his quest was done  and that he had found
her whom he had gone to seek  then there was a stir in the multitude
and a peal of bells rang out on the stillness without  the princess sank
down and felt as though she swooned

a kiss was on her lips  and she trembled  for she knew the moment had
come for the prince to claim her  but the kiss was sweet  the sleeping
beauty came slowly back to consciousness  she awoke  and before her was
a tall knight in silver armour  his handsome features were lighted up
with joy  she knew him well  and  enfolded in his embrace  she murmured
happily

it is you  o prince  the youth of my dream

and the little briar rose peeped in at the turret casement and nodded in
the breeze at the lovers as they sat close clasped  and as the bells
pealed forth  told the news to the ivy  which told it to the jessamine
until soon the tidings spread over the great city far and wide  and over
all the joyful land




the gamekeeper s daughter


just run up to the grange and tell her ladyship the bull pup is doing
nicely  and that you bandaged its leg as she showed you  make haste
lass  if you re not too tired  as her ladyship would like to know before
she drives out

all right  dad  i ll run  it s much too cold to walk

rogers  the gamekeeper  glanced with pride after the little retreating
figure  and then  as his old mother was standing in the draughty porch
awaiting him  he kissed her wrinkled face  and they entered the cottage
together

nancy was soon at the grange  her cheeks aglow under the scarlet hood of
her cloak  new people were at the big house  and there seemed a deal of
bustle going on  she waited in the vestibule and stared at the
brightness  at the beautiful pictures and decorations where  ever since
she had known the grange  all had been damp and decay  she had never
seen anything like this before  and she was enjoying the novelty  mixed
with awe at all the grandeur  when a little girl richly dressed  about
three years old  ran up to her  nancy dropped a little bob of a curtsey
as her grandmother had taught her to do to the gentry

little iris was not at all shy  and was full of one thought only  the
thought of christmas  so that she burst out with   d you know
to morrow s christmas day   and  without waiting for a reply  she
babbled on   i m going to have such boo ful things  a dolly that sends
kisses  a pamberlator for her to ride in  a gold watch with real ticks
and a titten with real scratches  guess who ll bring them

her ladyship   ventured nancy  dazzled at such a haul of magnificence

no  not mummy   exclaimed iris  capering with delight and revealing
more of her frills and laces

i can t guess  miss   said nancy  smiling through her diffidence  which
was just what iris wanted her to say

it s santa claus  santa claus always brings me just what i want  isn t
it clever

who s santa claus  is it your aunt  miss

i m  peaking to you about santa claus  a gen lman  i ve not seen
him  never been able to catch him yet

catch him  but who tells him what you want   she was getting quite
interested

the little bird

nancy felt completely mystified  what a different world this seemed to
hers

what toys are  you  going to get   continued iris

oh  no  toys   i live in the cottage in the forest  dad is always so
busy  and i help him look out for poachers  so i have useful presents  i
don t have toys  granny gave me this warm cloak last year  and then
dad s pockets get so full of sweets that they last for months

sweets and useful things aren t p esents   said iris  surprised   poor
little girl  wouldn t you like toys   she added

i think so  miss  at least  i ve not seen many  cousin janey has a
skipping rope and a workbox  but she won t let me touch them

ah  you ve been here long enough  iris darling  i hear nurse calling
you   exclaimed a soft voice  and her ladyship  with a kindly look at
the visitor  laughingly caught up her little daughter in her arms before
the child even knew she was there  then she received the message  gave
the little messenger a slice of cake  and in a moment nancy was
leisurely munching the fee as she trudged her way back on the grass
through the frosty park  the dusk was gathering  when suddenly in the
stillness she heard a dull thwack as of a stick against a branch  which
caused her to stop and listen  she knew what the sound meant

that s one of those poachers  he s knocked down a pheasant  i ll be
bound   said the gamekeeper s daughter to herself   i ll just be after
him   and  gathering her skirts close around her  she crept through into
a thick plantation  she had the intrepid fearlessness of her father
whose companion on his rounds she had been  when no danger was thought
to be afoot  ever since she was old enough to ride pickaback  it came
quite natural to her to help him  and though the old grandmother
grumbled at her boyish ways she said nothing  for the child was obedient
enough  and could read and write and sew  and  moreover  her son would
brook no interference with his treasure  especially since her mother had
died

drop that   cried nancy   who s there

hearing only a girl s voice  a rough looking fellow emerged grinning
from behind a tree  with the dead bird he had just picked up in his
hand  a limp bag was slung over his shoulder  a stout staff was in his
other hand  and a snarling  lurcher  dog slunk at his feet

steady  muffins   said the man  giving the cowering animal a gentle
kick as a reminder   now  missy  what can i do for you

illustration    you can just hand over that pheasant

you can just hand me over that pheasant  ah  it s you  is it  i know
you  tom grollins  and i ll report you to the gamekeeper

the poacher gazed at her stupidly for a moment   give you the blessed
bird and be reported too  missy  come  that ain t  ardly fair  is it
will  yer lie down  muffins   now look  ere  if i give yer the bird
will y promise not to say a word as it was tom grollins  on yer davey
now  will y promise  missy

she nodded  tom grollins was not very strong of intellect  and he was a
known coward  and as the sound of a carriage was heard close by  the
bargain was hastily concluded  the pheasant was handed over without
further parley on the undertaking of the promise   no names

the promise  of course  nancy faithfully kept when she delivered to her
father the bird she had demanded with such pluck and authority  and told
him how she had got it  the gamekeeper laughed  remarking that he
wouldn t press her  but could make a pretty shrewd guess if he chose
however  she was worth her weight in gold  he said  and he patted her on
the head for a trump  and nancy felt uncommonly proud  but she didn t
quite understand what he meant when he said that terms such as she had
made would not be quite approved of by the lord chancellor

then as granny came in nancy told of all she had seen  and of all the
wonderful presents the tiny lady at the grange was going to receive at
christmas  because she wanted them  and that a gentleman staying at the
house called mr  santa claus gave them  and knew what to get  because a
bird  a parrot  she supposed  had heard and told him what the little
lady wanted

that night when nancy was in bed she could think of nothing else but
santa claus and the wonderful toys  and the thoughts were just beginning
to get confused with a greatly envied skipping rope and workbox  when
she suddenly sat bolt upright in bed wide awake

her room was a tiny one leading off the kitchen  and in the moonlight
she had just seen tom grollins pass by  this time with a full bag on his
back  and the faithful muffins was close at his heels

well  i never did   exclaimed nancy  in her astonishment and vexation
unconsciously quoting her grandmother   i  never  did  now what s to be
done  gran s no use  dad s out  but dad s sure to find that wicked
poacher   she reflected  on hearing the clock strike nine   he s in the
forest  and can t be far   and she lay back  relieved at the thought
that her father had suspiciously refused the invitation of a shabby
gaitered  and very doubtful sportsman  to drink christmas in with
mulled beer at the village tavern  she had heard her father remark
afterwards that he wanted  to be within earshot of gunshot   so she
wouldn t worry  for tom wouldn t get the things after all



after a time nancy changed her mind  as in a dream  but not feeling a
bit sleepy  she quickly donned her cloak  stealthily opened the kitchen
door so as not to disturb the old lady  and hastened out into the night
curiously enough  she didn t feel cold in the bleak air  and in her
hurry she never even noticed she was without shoes or stockings

in front of her was a man  and she quickened her pace  she soon overtook
him  sooner than she expected  for dark clouds overshadowed the moon
and she was at his side before she knew it

tom grollins   she exclaimed  breathless and indignant   how dare you
i ve caught you again

i m not tom grollins   replied her companion in a deep  manly voice  in
which a funny chuckle seemed to rumble

for a moment the child hesitated  it certainly didn t sound like tom
grollins s whiny treble  but then  perhaps he was pretending  so as to
put her off

yes  you are   she retorted firmly   now  what are you doing here

it s a secret

you re after poaching again  i shall report you to dad  and   she added
severely   you ve just got to give me this very minute all you ve got in
that bag

all in my bag  softly  softly  wouldn t that be highway robbery  with
threats   answered the jolly voice  and with a laugh   oh  greedy

nancy stopped and stared hard  but it was too dark for her to see him
as she had done from her bed  he had stopped too

who are you  then   she asked lamely

santa claus   came the reply

santa claus   repeated the child in astonishment

the dark cloud wrack happened to part  and nancy saw towering above her
the dearest and most imposing old gentleman imaginable  with a large
smiling face and long white beard  white curly hair fringed his
holly decked scarlet cap  and his long  loose  red coat revealed here
and there glimpses of scarlet plush beneath  instead of rabbits and
pheasants  he was laden with the newest of toys  and as to muffins  he
was nowhere to be seen  unless he was that toy dog dangling from the
overflowing bag  and wearing a leather collar with bell attached  and
a leather muzzle that ought to allay the fears of the most nervous

illustration    who are you  then

yes  little woman  i am santa claus  himself   he repeated  with his
jolly chuckle

i  i  beg your pardon   stammered nancy  quite confused

it s all right   he replied good humouredly   now shall i see you home
before i continue my rounds

oh  may i come with you   the words had dropped out of her mouth before
she could stop herself

santa claus shook his head   come with me  indeed  i should think not
come with me   pon my word   then he hesitated and smiled  and said
kindly   well  come along  dear  you re a good  brave little girl  but
you must know i ve never made such an exception before  however  it s so
odd to find a child who doesn t know me  even such a little village
mouse as you  that we must really make one another s acquaintance

he drew nancy under his cloak to keep her extra warm  and to hide her
from view  and he showed her how she could peep out  then he took her by
the hand  and the quaint pair proceeded along the mysterious looking
forest until they came to the part nancy loved best  there  heaps and
heaps of fir trees grew  the tall ones protecting the wee ones  and the
wee ones doing their best to try and grow tall too

santa claus stood still  and looked around  as if in preparation of some
important matter  nancy felt something was going to happen  and she
peered up into the face of her guide

father christmas has come   he proclaimed loudly at last

and then what a change there was  the fir trees all became
christmas trees  lighted each one  big and little  with candles  blue or
green  yellow or red  each burning with the same coloured light  and
from the diamond frosted branches hung toys innumerable  at the top of
each tree stood triumphant a fairy doll with wand outstretched

nancy clasped her hands with rapture at the sight   oh  santa claus
was all she could exclaim

he lifted her on to his shoulder  and let her gaze until she had gazed
enough  now  indeed  she realised what toys were  whence they came  and
how they grew

then she felt he was carrying her away  and her heart beat with
curiosity and excitement  for she knew santa claus was proceeding on his
rounds to pay visits to all the sleeping children who deserved it  while
she was clinging to his dear old neck  and would see all that went on

the first visit was to iris at the grange  whither santa claus was
already on his way  they entered the pretty bedroom  where the spoilt
little lady was smiling in anticipation in her sleep  and the  dolly
pamberlator  watch  and titten with real scratches   immovably asleep
were all produced as though by some conjuring trick from santa claus s
basket or deep pockets  and duly placed to meet the child s eager glance
on her waking

mr  santa claus   whispered nancy  who had been wondering all the time
how did we get here

chimney   he whispered back

chimney

santa claus nodded

this didn t make her much wiser  for to her knowledge she had never seen
the inside of a chimney in her life  but she forgot to pursue the
subject now that something more interesting was going on

iris had vanished  and a pale little boy lay asleep in a room above a
flower shop

he doesn t care for toys   whispered santa claus   he loves that pink
geranium by his side   and a gaily painted watering pot was placed next
to his flowering possession   how white in comparison with the blossom
the suffering  pinched little face looks on the pillow   thought nancy
he  will  be pleased   before they left  santa claus filled the can
with water from the cracked toilet jug

in the large house across the way were sounds of bright music  a party
was going on

i m afraid it s too early to go there yet   said santa claus
consulting his great watch   however  we ll go and see  it s really high
time for all youngsters to be in bed   in the night nursery were two
cots  both were empty   i must call on my way back   he said

just then the door opened  and childish voices were heard shouting
santa claus  we ll catch him if we re quick

and there was only just time for the two travellers to disappear before
the lights were turned up and the owners of the cots rushed in

nearly caught that time   exclaimed santa claus  as they proceeded on
their way  it was extraordinary how alert and agile he was for such an
old and portly gentleman   and he burst out into a loud laugh  and only
recovered from it as they entered a long room full of small beds  it was
decorated with holly and mistletoe  a light burned at one end  where sat
a pleasant looking nurse half screened in the corner by the fire

nancy followed santa claus s movements with breathless interest as he
flitted to each little sleeping occupant of the hospital ward  for such
it was  placing here a toy horse of skin and harness with a long wavy
tail  there a lovely picture book with a green cover  on which the
title was printed in large gold letters

twice only did nancy heave a little sigh  quickly repressed  and her
eyes filled with longing  once when a skipping rope was loosely tied
round the clasped hands of a little girl who was convalescent  and was
going to leave  as santa claus explained  and once again when  creeping
on tiptoe  he placed under the chair of the dozing nurse a very smart
workbox  with the name engraved on top

every now and then santa claus would linger to smooth the look of pain
from a little suffering face into a smile  or touch with his cool palm a
little fevered hand

as she trotted round with him  tears of pity and happy sympathy filled
nancy s eyes  and she tried to give santa claus a good hug  only she
couldn t reach half way round  while he tenderly wiped those tears on
his big cuff  and carried her off  a long way  to a very poor cottage
there they peeped round from behind the door

everything looked bright  and sounded happy too  and every now and
again  amid the laughter and the chatter  the arrival of santa claus was
gaily prophesied  three little girls were dancing round three of those
tiny decorated christmas trees nancy had seen that eve  and their
parents  looking on happily  echoed their exclamations of joy  she was
surprised to see so much jollity in so poor a place  but santa claus
didn t seem to be so  he merely muttered   it s all right this year
and withdrew with her the same way they had come

and now   remarked santa claus cheerily   before i go back to the party
children or do anything else i must visit all the other hospitals  i ve
brought you home because you must be very tired  little woman  i m
terribly busy to night  half afraid i shan t get it over in time  just
think of the disappointment if i don t  so good night  nancy  pleasant
dreams  a merry christmas and a happy new year

and his kind face bent over her in bed  as it had over so many others
that christmas eve  and as he pressed her hand he added  with a smile
i ve a terrible lot to do  and i mustn t forget  anybody

the dawn heralded once again a christmas day  and when the sun peeped
forth he awoke nancy  she looked round  and uttered a cry of surprise
and delight  for before her astonished eyes she seemed to see a little
fairy land all to herself  grouped about her bed were a skipping rope  a
workbox  both handsomer than janey s  and a little box besides  she
couldn t believe they were real  so she felt them all over  and not only
found they were quite real  but the little box when it was touched sent
forth the most lovely  mysterious music

dear  kind  darling santa claus   exclaimed nancy  then she saw that
beside them there was also a plum pudding with a christmas card
attached  from the new mistress of the grange  what was puzzling was
that on a chair close by hung three pairs of her father s new socks with
a paper asking her to mark them  but they were marked already  and were
full of good things to eat

never in all her nine years had nancy had such a christmas  after saying
her morning prayers  she sat down at the table  where  with elbows
outspread and her little tongue peeping out as she moved her pen  she
wrote the following letter

dear mr  claus   thank you very much for those lovely
presents  i like them very much  and thank you for the lovely
time i had going about with you last night  i shall never
forget it  please forgive me for thinking you were the wicked
poacher  tom grollins  i must now say good bye

i send you 200 kisses  x x x etsetra

your grateful little friend
nancy rogers

and then she addressed it to him at the grange

when nancy had stamped and posted it  her grandmother and her father
came in to breakfast  and received nancy s grateful thanks  for she wore
a pretty new frock  then she told them that as she had hurried back
from the post box  so as not to be late for breakfast  she had heard the
head gardener say to the butler that tom grollins had been seen that
night striding quietly along with a big bag well stuffed

but  dad   continued his daughter with conviction   it isn t true  i m
sure it s a mistake

why isn t it true  lass   inquired her father   it s likelier to be
true than not

because i made the same mistake myself   said nancy

well  it would take a good deal to persuade me that my little meeting
with that slippery rascal turned out to be a mistake   exclaimed the
gamekeeper  as he set down his cup and smiled with satisfaction   when
did you meet him  little woman

last night

and who do you fancy it was  dearie   asked the old grandmother

i  know  who it was  gran  it was mr  santa claus   as they smiled
still  she ran and fetched his presents she was anxious to show

and nancy knew she was right  and that it  was  santa claus  for nothing
more was heard of the poacher tom grollins for ever so long  and every
one nancy asked seemed to know all about santa claus having been on his
rounds that night  even those who hadn t seen him

illustration   she ran and fetched his presents she was anxious to
show




all on a fifth of november

morning


it might have been the middle of the night  but it wasn t  it was guy
fawkes  day  and eight o clock on a foggy morning  the london square was
more than usually hushed and mournful  except for a warning call or
whistle as a van cautiously lumbered along  or blundered on to the
pavement  the nursery fire did its best to look cheerful  the lights
were all on too  showing up the bright pictures on the walls and the
bright faces of the three children who were chattering gaily at the
breakfast table  and they all looked so smart  alec and frank in their
best suits  and tiny molly wore her prettiest white frock and her coral
necklace  just as if she were going to a party

they soon scrambled off their chairs  and molly  standing on tiptoe
seized hold of a bunch of lilies tied up with ribbon that was on the
side table  and each of her brothers eagerly possessed himself of a neat
brown paper parcel

it was father s birthday  the occasion was always kept as a holiday  and
the children were waiting for his call to summon them to his
dressing room

i think he must be fifty   remarked alec

i fink he s fifteen   said their little sister

she spoke in a tone of conviction  accompanied by a toss of her short
curls

don t be silly  mollikins   replied the boys with a laugh  but she said
she was sure she was right

halloa  kidlets  come along down   came the shout of a manly voice
there was a stampede  and a race as to who should get there first  molly
arrived a bad third  but it was she who was first for him  for he went
towards her and picked her up  she put her free arm around his neck  but
instead of making him her little speech she exclaimed as he kissed her

why  daddy  your chin is full of splinters

the boys delivered their presents  and were kissed or patted on the
head  and thanked  before molly parted with the flowers which she held
so tightly in her little fist

your babyship is very kind   said her father  gratefully shaking her by
the hand  and  laughing still  he put her down  then he took her hint
and seriously began to shave

they knew they mustn t talk to him whilst that important function was
proceeding  so the three stood still  deeply absorbed as they watched
the performance that fascinated them with its dangers and its
hairbreadth escapes

now  i can kiss my little mollikins and she won t complain   he put
down the towel  took her up again  and rubbed his smooth cheek against
hers

daddy  tell me how old you are   she asked  looking into his eyes

oh  how can i do that  it s a secret

do whisper it   she coaxed  after a moment s hesitation he smilingly
whispered something into her ear

oh  what a  tock of years   she exclaimed

what is it   clamoured alec   i m sure i m right

i m sure i am   asserted frank

i  know    cried the delighted molly  bursting with importance   may i
tell   her father nodded   twenty one   she exclaimed triumphantly

bosh  why  he said he was that last year   cried frank

and the year before   asserted alec   and the year before that  i
remember quite well  father always says that

guy   called their mother just then   please send the children in to
me   she was having her morning tea  so the young people ran into the
adjoining room to hug her and be hugged in return


noon

sun s tum out   announced molly  as she toddled away from the nursery
window

hooray   shouted frank   it s going to be fine for this evening

there were going to be great doings  father s birthday and guy fawkes
day made a grand double event long looked forward to with enjoyment

hooray   echoed alec rather feebly  for he was desperately busy
outside  now that the fog had lifted  the busy hum could be heard of
everyday life  mingled with boys  shouts as they trundled a guy about

i ve found something out   suddenly exclaimed alec in a curious voice
and he spread out on the table the front page of an old  times    look
here  frank   he continued in growing excitement   here  under the
births  marked with red pencil   guy thompson   that s father  here s
the date  wait a moment  now i ll reckon it out  hush  don t say
anything while i do the sum   i say   father  is  twenty one

i  knew it   exclaimed molly  capering about   i told you so

rubbish   said frank   molly  do shut up  alec  where did you find that
paper  how did it come here

i found it there  on the rocking chair  it looks old  and it  is  old
see  here s the date  it s very funny  i wish we could find out  it
would  be jolly to find out all by ourselves  if this really can be
true  i say  i know who d tell us  i ve heard all about somerset
house  where you can get to know about people and their affairs  only i
don t know where the place is  or who lives there

an omlibus will take us anywhere   spoke up molly

who s  us    inquired frank scornfully

never mind  her    said alec excitedly   i ll tell you what  listen
this afternoon  when we ve got to be in the play room  let s go in a cab
to somerset house  and just get to know once for all  i ve got four
shillings in my money box  what have you got

i ll count   frank counted up to five shillings

the man may want more  mollikins  what have you got in your purse

dot sixpence

well  if you pay your share  we ll take you with us  that is  if you
can put on your own hat  i can help you with your coat   and so it was
arranged

and at three o clock that cold afternoon alec  frank  and molly might
have been seen stealing forth into the keen air  they were supposed to
be playing at marbles in the garret or they might have been seen  and
packed back again  the boys were well muffled up  and molly had her hat
on with the back to the front  the three were in high spirits once they
were off  and they realised the full importance of such an adventure  in
alec s hand was the sheet of newspaper in which the truth of the
paragraph was to be tested  alec hailed the first cab  the driver shook
his head  the second paid no attention  the third asked them who they
thought they were getting at and where they thought they were going to

somerset house   ordered alec  after quickly lifting molly in  and
frank had closed the door smartly  on the way there they behaved much
better than they usually did when they drove out  no one fidgeted  no
one complained of feeling hungry  or thirsty  or tired  or anything

when they alighted the cabman was told to wait  molly and her brothers
passed through the imposing gateway of somerset house  and were starting
to cross the quadrangle  when they saw the beadle in his fine uniform
whom they took to be the duke   and learned from him where they could
find the room of which they were in search

births  please   said alec  bold as brass  to the gentleman behind the
counter  he was leader and spokesman whenever they went shopping  and he
was leader and spokesman to day  frank never interfered  and molly had
gone stonily shy   births  please   repeated alec  impatient at being
stared at

what name   said the gentleman  looking at them amused

thompson   replied alec

any particular thompson  you see  we may have several thompsons in our
entries  five or six at least

this is mr  guy thompson   said alec  showing the marked paragraph

very well   said the gentleman  who  thought alec  must be the duke s
butler    but have you got the fee  the half crown you must pay for the
search

a half crown s very dear   said alec   can t you do it for less

the gentleman looked at them with kindly eyes   i dare say i can   he
replied  putting his hand in his pocket  and rattling some coins   but
i m afraid you ll have to pay a shilling  the king wants one   they paid
their shilling for the king  watched while the gentleman looked up his
records  and followed him into the corridor as he prosecuted his search
at last he said

quite right  born on the fifth of november  year s all right  it s all
in order

then father  is  twenty one   queried both boys doubtfully

molly hopped on one foot in suppressed excitement

your father    exclaimed the kindly clerk  handing back the coin
why  how old are you

ten   replied alec   thank you

and so your father married at the age of ten or thereabouts  did he
dear me  very precocious of him   exclaimed the clerk  with such a
serious face that the children felt quite uncomfortable  they had not
considered the matter in that light at all  their faces fell  and they
felt such a wish they had never come that without a word of explanation
they turned and fled  they were glad to be once more outside the
building  and thankful to find the cabman still there waiting to take
them back  and in their discomfiture he was hailed by them joyfully as a
dear old friend

home   said alec  when they were inside

and where might that happen to be   asked the driver with interest

molly  womanlike  jumped at a conclusion   we re lost   she wailed  and
burst into tears  and it was only when she was in sight of her own
nursery windows that she was comforted  and smiled once more  without
any inquiry  all their remaining savings were emptied into the willing
palm of the delighted driver  who bowed his acknowledgments repeatedly

the children ran through the garden entrance unobserved  and had just
got their outdoor things off when the tea bell rang


night

when alec  frank  and molly entered the drawing room  where their
parents were in readiness  for the great annual frolic with father  they
didn t tumble in as was their usual habit  they walked in sedately  they
had something important to say

truly  daddy  how old are you   asked molly  running up to him  she
wouldn t be hushed down by the boys  she felt she wanted to make sure of
what she already knew

i told you i was twenty one  of course  one always expects such a nice
lot of presents when one is twenty one  but you two young rascals
evidently think i really must be a very old man of forty at least   he
replied  smiling

and does he never grow older  mummy

i don t see it  molly darling

do you ever see the  times   boys   he inquired

that s just what s so queer   said alec   i ve got it here   alec
noticed the glance which his parents exchanged  and their expression of
astonishment when frank remarked

we took it with us this afternoon to somerset house

yes   corroborated alec

me  too   chimed in molly

and then they told of all they had done  and their parents tried to look
grave  but couldn t  and could scarcely speak for laughing  though they
extorted a promise that nothing of the kind should ever again be
attempted without permission

surely  what is in the  times    reasoned their father   must be
true  at least one must presume so

halloa   broke in alec   i say  frank  look here  this guy thompson was
born in cambridge square  i never noticed that  weren t you born in
oxford square  father

well  i think i might just as well have been born in one as in the
other  all i know is  that if i  was  twenty one  i am twenty one   and
the rest  you never asked me how many more  come along  boys  now for
our cushion fight  but first of all  here are your expenses back
again  your babyship  there s your sixpence  and now i really can t wait
any longer for a romp

soon the room was gay with laughter  father  too  had to be a real guy
and a  pretend  one  pushed about in the arm chair with a funny long
nose spoiling his jolly face  and afterwards they all danced whilst
their mother played a hornpipe  and really it  was  very difficult to
guess father s years  they might have been anything

then he suddenly ran out  there was a rush to the window  the blind was
drawn up  and soon  in the darkness of the night  a grand
catharine wheel was seen whizzing round in a blaze of dripping fire
then such a glorious shoot of rockets arose  whish  bang  whish  bang
they went as they burst  each of them  into a shower of gorgeous stars
all purple  and green  and gold

a  a  h   exclaimed the three children  gazing with rapture  and

a  a  h   they repeated over and over and over again  as splendour
followed splendour  and the sky was powdered again and again with sparks
of coloured fire




father christmas at home

twilight


it was afternoon on a cold december day  eva  all alone in the
schoolroom  sat down on the hearthrug and looked thoughtfully into the
fire  she was  however  not quite alone  for her tiny yorkshire terrier
sprang on her lap  and after turning round and round  pawing at her
frock as though to make a comfortable hollow  settled cosily down

dot   she said  smoothing the hair back from its eyes   i m very
miserable  to morrow is christmas eve  and every one is happy except me
i m in trouble again  somehow  i m always in trouble  i ve spoilt my
velvet frock washing your feet  and you didn t want them washed  did
you   the honourable dot  to give it its full title  looked desirous of
forgetting the incident  then licked her hand as a reply seemed
expected

perhaps if i had some brothers and sisters they d get into mischief
sometimes  and it wouldn t always be me   dot paid no heed to her
grammar  was bored  and sighed heavily

i really didn t mean it when i said   i gloried in being naughty
don t snore  honourable  there ll be complaints from next door

it was curious  but eva was having remorse  brought on by all the talk
of peace and goodwill which was in the air   i ve tried things before
she muttered   but i know what i ll do this time   she exclaimed   i ll
give a cot to a hospital

the little dog growled a protest as she suddenly got up from the floor
eva counted the money in her money box   i ve five shillings all but
three farthings  i m sure that is nothing like enough   she mused   it
must cost at least a million sterling pounds   tears came into her eyes
but they flowed down on to a smile  as she thought of some one who
always managed to do kind deeds and who might help her  father
christmas  eva thought of asking no less a person than father christmas
himself to advise her  but how to find him and get a nice quiet chat
with him was the difficulty  that he would come to her on christmas eve
she had no doubt  as he never forgot her  but she had only managed to be
awake and see him once  a long time ago  and then she but got a glimpse
of him  for he rushed out of her room as though in a terrible hurry

dot s little mistress slept badly that night  she was racking her brain
as to how she could manage to remain awake so as to see father
christmas when he came  and then how she could coax him to stay for a
talk  for she knew quite well how busy he must be when he was on his
rounds

the following afternoon  during a general rummage that was going on to
find tiny candles and coloured glass balls that were over from last
year s christmas tree  eva picked up a scrap of printed paper  which had
come out of an old cracker  she took it upstairs to her favourite spot
on the hearthrug  and read it aloud to dot

father christmas sends this note
from out his mansion by the moat
to all who live on land and sea
to honour christmas day with glee
inviting them to pass his way
with glee to honour christmas day

eva flushed with excitement   why  it s a message from him   she cried
it s some kind of invitation   and she gave dot such a squeeze of
delight that the little creature squeaked shrilly  scurried off  and
laid low under the table

she thought and puzzled and pondered over the lines she had just read
at last she grasped their meaning   of course  how simple  after all
she concluded   he lives at some moated house  and i must go to him  not
wait for him to come to me  he always comes down the chimney  that s
the way i must go up

eva didn t hesitate a moment  the opportunity had come for which she
longed  she ran downstairs into the large  old fashioned hall  which was
overheated as usual  by the hot air pipes  for the huge chimney place
was too much of a curiosity ever to be used  here  she felt sure  was
the starting point of her adventure

luckily no one was about  it was windy when she looked up the great
chimney  so she took her long  fair hair  and made it into a loose plait
in order to keep it from blowing about her face  then she prepared to
start and secure the first footing

eva had never been up a chimney before  and when she began climbing she
was quite surprised to find how nice and clean it was  with steps  and
all white tiles  she toiled up  and up  and could see blue sky and
fleeting white clouds above  after a time she stopped to rest in a
little recess in the chimney side  when she started climbing again  the
blue sky faded away  twilight came on  and in this very  very long
chimney the light became quite dim

very soon  however  she felt with a little thrill of pleasure the keen
air all around her head and shoulders  and she knew she had come to the
top  fortunately there was a ladder  already placed for father
christmas to mount  and down that she went  looking below all the time
so as not to make a false step  it was a very  very long ladder indeed
and eva began to think she would have to go on stepping down for ever
when at last she found herself on the ground again  in a country field
with hoar frost stiffening the blades of grass  across which she ran
straight ahead as hard as ever she could go


starlight

once only did she halt by the side of a lane to consider what she should
do if she couldn t find her destination after all  two robins alighted
in front of her  hopped about  and fluttered forward  they were so
persistent that they interested her and she followed them  they flew
along a side path  and eva ran after them  ran till she arrived eager
and breathless at a wooden bridge  and found that she was in a park
that above her was the dark vault of heaven decked out in all its
diamonds  that the bridge led across a moat  and that in front of her
was a splendid old country mansion brilliantly lighted up  where the
robins alighted on a window sill  and paying no further attention to
her  busied themselves with crumbs

illustration   it was a very  very long ladder

then eva advanced  almost in spite of herself  went up the front steps
and standing on tiptoe  lifted the knocker and let it fall  the knocker
resounded for a while musically  like a peal of bells  when they ceased
the door opened  and a very ancient man confronted her  he was tall and
thin and bent  and was dressed in draperies  with bare legs  and he had
a funny little curl in the middle of his bald forehead

is father christmas at home  please   faltered eva

yes  little madam   came the reply   do you want to see him  really
but you will be astonished  i warn you  aren t you frightened

not a bit   replied eva

brave little girl   said the very ancient man   come in   and he
ushered her into an old oak panelled room  it had a delicious sense of
comfort  and a delight about it which  for the moment  she didn t try to
define  her attention was attracted by catching sight of what she
thought was her own reflection in the large mirror against the wall  it
was a little girl who came in at the same time  and was of exactly her
own height  as she looked closer she saw that the other child was uglier
than herself  unkind in expression  slovenly in appearance  and tried to
hide herself  rather  in the dark corner where she remained  and eva
in the novel surroundings  soon forgot all about her

at the far end was a great log fire  and near it a huge arm chair  in
which sat a stout  healthy  red faced old gentleman warmly wrapped in a
crimson dressing gown  he was leaning back  thinking or dozing  eva
advanced with soft steps  she was full of eagerness and excitement  for
she recognised the white bearded  handsome old face at once from the
many coloured portraits she had seen  it was father christmas himself
eva never knew what impelled her to do it  but when she got close to him
she simply threw her arms around his neck and kissed him

bless my soul   exclaimed father christmas  starting  and catching her
up  he seated her on his knee  he recognised her at once   how you ve
grown since last year  eva   and he looked at her with beaming eyes   i
suppose you know you re trespassing  and the penalty is forty crackers
or a kiss   and he chuckled and laughed so merrily that she felt quite
comfortable  finding trespassing a very pleasant occupation  and wasn t
a bit alarmed at the penalty

and what brings me this honour   he continued

good evening  father christmas   spoke up eva quite boldly   i m afraid
i disturbed you

illustration    i suppose you know you re trespassing

oh yes  you ve disturbed me all right   he replied briskly   but i was
only resting a little after my labours before going on my rounds
to night

what labours

toys  toys and sweets  i ve been making toys and things all the year
through  and have only just got them finished in time  i love making
crackers  too  i spend all my evenings writing mottoes for them

i found your invitation  mr  christmas

bless me  did you now  ah   he stroked his beard thoughtfully for a
moment and remained silent  eva looked about her in amazement

those are all secrets   he observed after a time  father christmas
included with a sweep of the arm the toys which were everywhere
about  hanging from the ceiling  lying about on the tables and sofas
standing as ornaments on the mantelpiece  filling the shelves of the
bookcases  peeping from behind the glass cabinets  toys wherever one
looked

he arose  and taking her by the hand  led her round to enjoy the pretty
sight  and paying no attention whatever to the sullen little girl in the
corner  he asked eva if she would like to see around his domain   oh
yes  yes   she cried  she quite appreciated the special honour that was
being done her

they ll be coming in here soon to pack   he added   i m going to leave
all these secrets myself at their destinations

there was a tremendous bustle going on at the rear of the premises
where a whole army of packers  carriers  postmen  and porters were
hurrying about letting down toys from the loft  packing them  labelling
them to places far and wide  loading them on huge vans which came
rumbling in and out of the courtyard with cracking of whips  and parting
shouts of  good luck

superintending the arrangements  walking to and fro  was the very
ancient man  he was so alert  and always on the spot where wanted  yet
eva was thinking his age must at least be two hundred  when father
christmas said kindly   my dear  this is my father  he is known as
father time  and you have known him without having really met him face
to face before

i didn t recognise him  and i didn t know he was your father  sir   she
whispered

why  yes  don t you know that my full name is christmas time

of course it is   she exclaimed with a laugh

the next visit was through a covered way to the printing works  where
the mottoes and  directions  for toys and father christmas s visiting
cards were printed  these cards were all different in design  and each
was a beautiful picture stamped with his name  and his own motto   peace
and goodwill

behind was the sweet factory  with its tempting packets and muslin
stockings of all sizes full of sugar plums  but  as father time
appeared  father christmas whispered that he feared they must not
linger  and led the way up a spiral staircase in order to enable eva to
have a peep into the toy loft  where men were letting the toys down into
the busy yard below  how she would have loved to stay longer in each
delightful place  but without a murmur she followed her guide below and
back to the oak panelled room  it looked so bare and different without
the toys  much like any ordinary room

and now  my dear   he said   you must excuse me for a short time  as i
must go upstairs and get ready

please  ought i to be going   she asked politely

no  no  not yet   and he went away  up the grand staircase  to his
bedroom  there he took from the drawer his scarlet fur lined cloak and
hood with wide swansdown trimming  which had been put away in lavender
chose his thickest top boots  and humming a song  proceeded to array
himself for the long  cold journey in store for him that night

meanwhile  the moment he left his little visitor downstairs  the
strange looking child approached her

what s your name   asked eva pleasantly

eva   came the surly reply

why  that s my name

of course  i know you  i know you through and through  good and
bad  and i wish i didn t

you re a horrid story teller   said eva angrily

supposing i am  it s easier to tell stories than to tell the truth
saves a lot of trouble  besides  it s nice  you know that as well as i
do

eva would have liked to deny it  only she felt too scornful    saves
trouble   she said to herself    makes  trouble   but she flushed as she
remembered she had once thought that too  but only for a moment  and she
was ashamed of it now  she was ruffled and uncomfortable at the
proximity of this horrid girl  who now said slyly   look over there in
that cupboard  there s a doll that has been forgotten  i want it  and
i m going to take it and hide it under my pinafore

you mayn t  you mustn t   cried eva   it would be stealing

i don t care  father christmas won t know

yes  he will  i shall tell him

then i ll say it was given to me

you horrid girl  you dreadful story teller

don t be silly  what does it matter telling stories and stealing  so
long as you re not found out

it s just as bad if you re not found out  but you are  bound  to be
found out   cried eva  in horror and disgust as she saw her approach the
coveted treasure   i tell you  wicked people are always found out  they
never escape unpunished

i want it  and i m going to have it

you mustn t  come away  you shan t   shouted eva  running after her
and she seized her by both wrists   come away  oh  do come away

you fool  leave me alone  get away   and with a scoffing laugh the girl
shook herself free  sprang on a sofa  opened the cupboard  and stretched
out her hand

without a word eva threw herself upon her  slammed to the glass door
and in the struggle they fell together on the floor  there was a crash
of broken glass  and through the noise eva heard the voice of her
opponent saying faintly   let me go  you have won

when she got up  carefully shaking the bits of glass from her frock  and
looked round  the horrid little girl had disappeared  the next moment
her host stood in the doorway with a curious smile on his face

i m going now   he said   will you come

oh  please  father christmas   exclaimed eva ruefully  as she looked at
the glass on the floor   do wait  i want to explain something  i

i can t keep my father waiting   he answered gently  she followed him
to the front door  there in the frosty night a beautiful sledge was in
waiting  hung with baskets and sacks overflowing with toys and sweets
father christmas took his seat and beckoned to eva  to her joy he lifted
her on to his lap and wrapped his great coat about her  father time  who
was on the box  shook the reins  and the two reindeer  impatient to be
off  sped rapidly away amid the jangling of bells  carrying the
travellers over the bridge  through the park  past holly and fir trees
all powdered with glistening frost  out over the country into the
bright  crisp night


moonlight

there was eva with father christmas  all snug amongst his soft furs  on
his rounds   why do you take some toys yourself   she asked   and send
others away in the great carts

those in the carts are for my export and wholesale trade  shops  and so
on  these  i  take are for my special favourites  you re on my list  my
dear  you know   eva s heart was full of tenderness and pride  but tears
were in her eyes as she said  peering appealingly into his kind face

may i whisper something

he bent his head  and she whispered

bless my soul   was all father christmas replied  but he looked very
pleased and jolly

and i should like to pay for it   continued eva   i ve got five
shillings all but three farthings

never mind about that  my dear

but i m sure i ought   she replied dubiously   dear father christmas
you are always doing kindnesses  could you tell me how to do something
like giving a cot to a hospital  or a free library  or something  that s
what i really came to ask you about  only i forgot it until now  i m so
often in trouble  and i ve so often tried to do some good  but it
doesn t come off somehow   and she sighed

what you ask me is a secret   he answered   some people are quick to
find it out for themselves  some people never find it out  but i will
tell it to you  dear  because i know that by to morrow you will be on
the high road to guessing it  it is this  you need not give things  you
needn t try to be good  try only not to be troublesome  if you are
sweet  and gentle  and kind  you give happiness  not only do you give
it  but you can then only find happiness yourself   somehow  it didn t
sound a bit like a sermon  it was more like being told the delightfully
easy answer to a difficult sum  eva nestled closer to her dear old
friend as she listened  it was all so peaceful  reassuring  and
soothing

illustration   the two reindeer     sped rapidly away

the moon was shining down on the sledge and its strange occupants  and
eva was just going to ask if he could tell her who the other little girl
was  and all about her  when she felt her arms were being disengaged
from where they clung about him  and she found herself gently deposited
on firm ground  and alone



the honourable dot barked with delight because it was christmas eve  and
it was going with its little mistress to dine downstairs  and very
joyful and succulent the event proved to be  not long after  when it was
fast asleep in its basket  eva was sitting up in bed waiting anxiously
to receive the visit of her recent host  father christmas had done her
so much good  and she wanted to tell him so  as she had had no
opportunity of doing before

she was dropping asleep in that attitude  when she heard a slight noise
immediately she started up  and clutching tightly at a rapidly
retreating figure  she laughed aloud to find she had succeeded in
catching father christmas  who  mildly yielding to her entreaties  sat
down by her side

i have wakened you   he said regretfully

oh no  i was waiting for you   and she told him about the happy time
she had spent with him  and thanked him nicely   what a dreadful little
girl that other eva was   she concluded   who was she

ah   said father christmas very quickly   she is what you might be were
you to give way to bad feelings  i wish you a merry christmas and a
happy new year  my dear   and without explaining further he kissed her
and rapidly withdrew on his business


daylight

outside the uncurtained window the sun was shining  snow had been
falling softly  and was piled high on the sill  and over the hushed
landscape from the far distance the christmas bells were ringing  eva
joyfully hugged a large doll  which she had found asleep on her pillow

it was only later  when she thought over past events in detail  that it
appeared to her  though she had not paid attention to it at the time
that father christmas seemed ill at ease when he was  her
visitor  perhaps it was because he was in a hurry  somehow he was
different from the stout  merry faced old gentleman she had been to see
he had strangely shrunk to nearly as thin as her own father  and as
pale  comparatively  which she thought very odd

and when she looked up into that wonderful and mysterious old chimney
again  she saw that it was all dark and black  and as uninviting as any
ordinary dirty old chimney  so that it was quite hopeless for her ever
to venture up it again to find old father christmas  at home




a birthday story


if it had not been maisie s birthday this story could never have been
written  but the day had come for her to be five years old  and  like
every child of that age  she could no more help having a fifth birthday
than she could imagine having it without a party  at present she was
unconscious of all the delights in store  because it was only just dawn
and her curls were still tumbled about her flushed face on the pillow
and her eyes were still fast closed in sleep

but in a small bed quite close to hers there was a little girl  who was
very wide awake indeed  as she leant over with neck outstretched  gazing
eagerly at all the beautiful things so temptingly displayed on a table
at the foot of maisie s cot  presents from every one in the house
hilda s box of beads bought with her own money  a long promised
story book resplendent in bright blue and brilliant in gold  some new
furniture for the doll s house  and a something that glittered
strangely  hilda nearly toppled over in her curiosity to see it  she
found it to be a big red cracker with a funny coloured portrait of a
smirking crocodile stuck on the outside   what lovely things   she
thought   and all for maisie

in two months  time hilda was going to celebrate  her  birthday and be
eight years old  and have a fuss made over  her   but two whole months
seemed such a long way off  such a very long time to wait  into her dark
eyes there came a strange look of envy and longing  and her handsome
face with the resolute expression contrasted strangely with her sister s
as she turned anxiously towards the fair little sleeper

holding her breath  hilda crept slowly down on to the floor  stealthily
approached the table  and seized the beautiful cracker   surely that
would not be missed   she reflected  just then maisie stirred uneasily
which brought a flush of shame to the elder girl s cheeks  but hearing
nothing further  hilda jumped into bed and pushed the cracker under her
own pillow  the crackling of the paper woke maisie  who sat up  and in
the middle of a big yawn espied the table  and remembered the great
event   oh  hilda   she exclaimed   just look   she was too excited as
she handled her treasures to notice that hilda never stirred  that she
only answered shortly   yes  i know   and didn t even volunteer to say
whom the beads came from

during the whole morning maisie s excitement continued  she hopped about
everywhere  watching the arrangements for the afternoon party  and
chattering about who were coming  so much so  that do what she would
hilda could obtain no opportunity of being alone so that she might
satisfy her burning curiosity as to what was inside the cracker  she had
dropped it behind the toy box in the nursery  and there it lay  whilst
all the time maisie could not understand what made her sister so
restless and impatient

immediately after lunch  however  hilda was able to satisfy her longing
at last  she picked up the cracker and hurriedly opened it  what first
came to light was a big sweet wrapped in a printed motto   always do
what is right and you will be happy   she read it with a pang of mental
shame  which was quickly followed by one of physical discomfort  for she
had popped the sweet into her mouth and now would as quickly have popped
it out again  only it was too late  as she had already swallowed the
horrid thing  which was filled with a liquid that tasted of bad scent
making a wry face  she rolled up the offending motto into a tiny ball
and threw it into the empty grate  still  it was soothing to find in the
cracker a neatly rolled up packet of pink and green paper  which
evidently formed something amusing  a bonnet  a cap  or perhaps an
apron  at the same time she drew forth the  cracking thing   which she
loved to pull and hear it go  crack   but she always did so at arm s
length with her head turned away  and she was too frightened to pull it
all by herself

their nurse s voice was heard calling maisie to come up and be dressed
hilda  with a guilty  conscience stricken look  had barely time to throw
the useless  cracking thing  out of the open window  and to hide the
rest of the cracker in the first thing at hand  which happened to be the
doll s house   when they both entered laughing and carried her off too
to be curled and be ribboned for the party

i ve seen my birthday cake  hilda   cried maisie  capering about   it s
booful   but hilda still tasted that nauseous liqueur from the sweet
and couldn t enter into any pleasing ideas of cake

ready first  she ran into the nursery  curious as ever as to the pink
and green paper bundle  took it out  unfolded it  and found that it
would have formed a crown  only it didn t join together  she had torn it
in her hurry  she stamped her foot with vexation  and was wondering if
she could stick the two ends together when that tiresome maisie came
running in from the next room with one of her new bronze shoes on to
show how beautiful it looked  quick as lightning hilda had to hide her
secret again

what are you doing with the doll s house  look at my new shoe
exclaimed maisie all in a breath

and hilda made a great fuss over the new shoe  and felt horridly out of
temper

punctually on the stroke of three  the first of the birthday party began
to arrive  two little girl cousins  who at once begged to be allowed to
see if there was anything new in the doll s house  hilda s heart sank at
these words  and she tried to draw their attention away  but to no
avail  for maisie  moving towards it  said they must see the new
treasure there  with difficulty and something like a scuffle hilda
grown desperate  prevented her from opening it  and managed to do so
herself  quickly stuffing the bunch of paper into her pocket without
being noticed  much admiration was bestowed on the new addition  a
little motor car which had been conveniently placed in the kitchen of
the doll s house ready to take out for an airing the little china lady
and gentleman who sat so rigidly and smiled so vacantly in the storey
above

meanwhile  hilda was inwardly owning to a feeling akin to dislike for
the very thought of that cracker  for the paper was bulging out her
pocket  flatten it as she would  she was not happy  for never before had
she done anything underhand  in fact she always tried to be an example
for her young sister  and she already regretted having given way to the
momentary impulse of envy  however  there was no time now for thoughts
or remorse  and when she reached the drawing room she forgot all about
her trouble in helping to receive the guests

eight little girls were grouped in one corner of the room whispering
with eyes busily engaged staring at one another s sashes  whilst eight
little boys had flocked together and were looking sheepishly from out of
an opposite corner  one boy  however  who had been gazing long at
hilda  with heroic resolution detached himself from his kind  and
entered the rival camp  where he was welcomed with pleasure and
interest  he was a young highlander  with sandy hair and many freckles
but his attraction was great  for he wore his native costume  the
jewelled hilt of a dagger showed above one plaid stocking  and on his
shoulder he wore a fascinating brooch with a large brown stone  which
was the envy and admiration of all the little ladies present

suddenly the guests were all swooped upon by a big lady  maisie s
mother  mixed up  and disentangled into couples  a piano was set going
and they danced  hopped  and twirled about  wondering if they liked it
the girls thought they did  and the boys were sure they didn t  all
except the scotch boy  who had constituted himself hilda s devoted
partner  and was enjoying it immensely  the polka finished  these two
sat chatting merrily at the window  when all at once hilda became
silent  she happened to catch sight of something sticking out of the ivy
on the sill  it was the  cracking thing  which she had thrown from the
window above  her partner was surprised to see her look as though she
were going to cry  she didn t dare do that

just then tea was announced  weighty recollection of warnings from
home counsellors came to the minds of the children  which warnings
however  conveniently faded away at sight of the good things set forth
so temptingly in the dining room  custards  jellies  and all those
concoctions beloved of the youthful interior  but the chief interest
centred in maisie s gorgeous cake  which had her name and age flowingly
written in coloured sugar  surrounded by the most realistic and sweetest
of red roses imaginable  nestling in the coolest looking golden leaves

hilda sat by the side of her scotch cavalier  who had taken her in  and
who was much concerned when he found that she had no appetite  but less
distressed when he found that that fact did not affect his

once during the meal  hilda heard their mother ask maisie  as she helped
her cut the birthday cake  what was in her cracker  and maisie replied
as she looked up from her struggles   what cracker   but then  in her
anxiety to know why hilda refused to taste any of her cake till the
morrow  she did not pursue the subject

after tea more excitement  for there was mr  punch and his company  who
were in excellent form

oi  oi  oi   repeated that gentleman for the dozenth time  as he bobbed
about aimlessly  in his anxiety to hit the clown and take the patient
toby between his jointless arms

later on  the eyelids of the party children began to grow heavy  though
the eyes remained unnaturally bright  and tempers became less even and
more natural  and so  like everything else  the birthday party came to
an end  and  good byes  were said with regret  that night cots and beds
were not despised  nor did they prove unwelcome for once  for little
tired heads were rested gratefully on cool pillows  maisie was an
exception  she tossed about on hers  too happy and excited to get to
sleep  whilst hilda  worn out  lay on her back with her mouth wide open
breathing heavily  and dreaming

hilda dreamt that she was alone in a boat on a ruffled lake  on a white
flag in the prow was a motto printed large  but upside down  she dreamt
that all around the frail craft  which rocked on the stormy waters  were
grinning crocodiles wearing broken crowns made of pink coral and green
fluttering paper  she crouched low and tried to hide  for she knew that
if the horrid creatures found her out she was lost for ever  land was
quite close  but she didn t know how to get there  because her frock
was made of red crackling stuff  which glistened and made a noise
whenever she moved

she felt sick with fright  and sobbed and moaned at her terrible plight
and sobbing  she woke to find that it was quite dark  that the moon was
shining on maisie smiling in her sleep  and that she herself had been
dreaming

at breakfast next morning  maisie and their mother were already seated
when hilda silently took her place next her chattering little sister
but it seemed to her that their mother looked unusually grave  when
hilda lifted the cover off her bread and milk bowl  maisie suddenly
looked in it and exclaimed   oh  how pretty   but hilda turned very red
and she hung her head ashamed  for in the bowl there was no bread and
milk  nothing but a crumpled red glazed paper with a hateful picture of
a smiling crocodile  something pink and green  a tiny paper ball of
printed paper  and a stiff thing sticking up  easily guessed at  but now
blurred and indistinct to hilda s tearful view

oh  maisie   she sobbed   it was your crack  cracker  i  i took it from
your table  do forgive me  i ve been so  so very miserable

and their mother  rising gently and saying nothing  quickly took the
proofs of wrong doing away  whilst hilda felt maisie s arm creep round
her neck and maisie s kisses on her wet cheek

and in her repentance her fault was forgiven

two months later  hilda found amongst the presents on her birthday table
a lovely cracker made of silver paper with a little heart of real gold
attached with a blue ribbon on the outside  and then hilda ran and
whispered eagerly in her mother s ear  who looked very pleased and
kissed her  and maisie was surprised and happy too  for hilda put in her
hand the lovely cracker with its little heart of gold for her very own
to keep




little starry


i should like to go shooting  and see what the earth is like   sighed a
young star  but the evening star knew that meant many dangers  for down
there life was not so happy or serene as up in their lofty sphere  and
she knew  too  that he would go his own way as youth always does  and
she felt sorry  for she did not like to part with this bright little
star  and so he went  that fine crisp night the tiny star was seen to
shoot right down to earth  and the light of his presence was no longer
there



a hard frost was on the ground  the shops were shut  for it was boxing
day  those who were not on enjoyment bent were snugly quartered by their
own fireside  with the firm conviction that nothing would tempt them
away  some  however  had business to attend to in spite of its being a
holiday  and old joshua was one of these  he was known as  old  joshua
because his hair had turned prematurely white  as white as the rime
which had gathered on his shabby hat as he hurried along the murky
dimly lighted street which led to the great theatre  the wind that
entered so unceremoniously through his thin coat was biting cold  the
violin he carried was more carefully muffled up than he

one  two  three   he counted  as a neighbouring clock began chiming
four  five  six

he quickened his pace  he had to be in his place in the orchestra in
extra good time  as it was the first night of the new pantomime  and
before that  he had some one coming to meet him at the back entrance

i shall be there all in good time   he muttered   by jupiter   he
exclaimed  as he tripped and nearly fell over something that was lying
straight in his path  only when he stooped down did he discover that on
the pavement lay a small child  all cold to the touch  with fair curls
dishevelled  and eyes wide open that seemed to see nothing

old joshua s heart filled with pity and indignation   what a shame   he
muttered   to abandon such a treasure as this  and no one about who can
help me   he looked anxiously around  no one was in sight  so he
hurriedly went in search of a policeman  when he had succeeded in
finding one  and the two reached the spot together  a crowd had
collected and was gazing wonderingly at the tiny  prostrate form

stand back there   commanded the man of law

the clock chimed the quarter hour  old joshua felt the cold no more  he
was in a nervous heat at the delay  nevertheless  he waited till a cab
was hailed  then the policeman tenderly lifted the helpless little
creature into it  and the driver wrapped his rug around it   to the
orspital   directed the policeman  stepping inside  and the vehicle was
driven smartly away  the crowd dispersed  and with it old joshua  as
quickly as he could hurry through the throng

at the stage door he found his little stella awaiting him with sparkling
eyes  in anticipation of her annual treat

daddy  you re late   she said  holding up a finger in mock gravity
then she clapped her hands with delight at his arrival

old joshua would not distress her with the cause of his delay  so he
only stooped and kissed her   give me your hand  old lady   he said
and come along quickly  through this door  that s right  up you go
don t step on my poor toes or push against me when we turn the corner
more than you can help  or old daddy joshua and his fiddle might be a
little out of tune   and  laughing as they went  they climbed right up
to the top back row of the vast empty theatre  there a smiling
attendant welcomed her as quite an old little friend  and when he had
seen his daughter raised up on a seat by means of a big hassock  old
joshua  with a nod of thanks  hastened below to join his comrades of the
orchestra  and help create the squeaky din which they called  tuning
up

at last the lights were turned up  an eager troop of pleasure seekers
tumbled into the gallery in a rush  and while stella was looking around
her every available seat was quickly occupied  the other parts of the
house were filling rapidly in more dignified style  and soon every place
was tenanted in honour of the great christmas pantomime  the large
orchestra struck up  and when the overture was over the gorgeously
painted curtain slowly rose

stella  perched up aloft  forgot where she was  and everything else in
the world went straight out of her head as she gazed with rapture at the
lovely scene that was peopled with fairies  and goblins  and wonderful
beings  disporting themselves in a land that was all glitter and gold
and so the hours flew by  in a wonder of loveliness  fairy story  and
fun

ave a bit o  orange  dearie   asked the stout woman who was sitting
next to her  but stella was too engrossed to think about oranges or
neighbours  nor even did she feel the light nudge that followed  the
woman merely turned to her husband  smiled  and held her peace  while
stella threw back her head and shook with laughter  as the clown tickled
pantaloon with a poker that looked extremely red hot  she wasn t a bit
tired  and was quite surprised to hear  god save the king   and to find
the whole beautiful show was already over  like a dream  it had seemed
to her as though it must go on for ever

flushed and excited  and a good deal jostled by the moving crowd  she
made her way to the staircase in order to meet the motherly attendant on
the next landing  who had promised to take her to her father at the
stage door  stella was walking down carefully step by step  when two
young men came roughly tearing past her  a sudden push threw her off her
balance  she knew she screamed because she heard it  then she knew and
heard nothing more



great fun was going forward in the biggest ward in the children s
hospital  father christmas had suddenly appeared amidst much cheering
and clapping of hands  not only were the little inmates  the nurses  and
young doctors beaming with smiles  but father christmas himself felt the
glow of jollity as he busily handed the toys he carried to his two
attendant clowns  these nimble  funny fellows ran from him to the cots
backwards and forwards  giving such beautiful toys  and saying such
funny things as they gave them  that every child was soon laughing and
happy  even those with a bandaged head or limb  or a pain inside or
outside  and the unwonted excitement brought a flush to their pale
cheeks and brightness to their eyes

but none of the jollification was seen by the new little inmate of the
cot that was in the far corner  a tiny blind boy lay there  with pretty
fair curls  and large dark eyes that he turned pathetically around  he
had not spoken at all  earlier in the evening he had shivered much  and
groaned  now he lay peacefully smiling  for his small hands held a
musical box that father christmas himself had placed there  and set
working  and the tinkle tinkle of a pretty tune seemed to please and
soothe him

when the christmas visitors had gone away  and the dolls had been hushed
to sleep by their new mothers  and the woolly animals lay hugged tightly
in the arms of drowsy owners  a little girl in a swoon from an accident
was carried into the ward  the sprained ankle had been dressed  quietly
and quickly she was put to bed  and consciousness soon returned

where am i   said stella  staring about her

you fell down  dear   replied nurse evelyn   and we are taking care of
you until you are fetched home  you ll soon be all right again  does
your ankle hurt much  don t move it

it feels funny   replied stella   but doesn t hurt now it is
still  thank you very much   she added  staring about her in amazement
at the strange faces  the holly in the strange surroundings  at the
nurses in their pretty costumes with their white caps and aprons  and at
the sleeping children clutching their toys  in the cot next to hers
however  the little fair haired boy looked awake  his eyes in their
aimless wandering were now fixed on the high window through which the
stars were twinkling at him  and the evening star looked fixedly down
upon him  his hands lay listlessly on the polished wooden box  the music
had changed  and in his ear it sang of  angels ever bright and fair

stella  who was watching him with so much interest  asked who he was

he is a little foundling   said nurse evelyn   he was abandoned in the
cold streets

stella turned her head on the pillow towards him again  and asked
timidly

are you better

talk to him to morrow  dear   advised nurse evelyn

as she gazed at him stella thought she had never seen so beautiful a
child  she stretched out her arm and took his tiny palm in hers  then he
turned his face towards her and smiled  contentedly and trustingly
leaving his hand in hers  and thus with love and pity in her heart she
fell fast asleep

and in the night she saw a wonderful thing  a moonbeam that seemed to
come down into the room  the small hand in hers unloosed itself  and the
boy arose looking gloriously beautiful  his eyes were shining  and he
could see the bright light  and he began climbing up the beam  so easily
that it looked like gliding  so happily now that he could see his way
and whither it was leading him

the next morning stella s first thought was of the lovely vision  and of
her little companion  she turned over and looked with surprise  the cot
in the corner was empty  so very empty  and tidy with its smoothed fresh
sheets

oh  where s he gone   she exclaimed

nurse hurried to her side   who  dear

there  from the empty cot

the nurse looked sweet and grave   he has gone where he came from
dear

and where did he come from   asked stella  with a curious sense of
loneliness

where all children come from

of course  stella knew that all children are heaven born  and come from
the stars  why  her own name meant a star  and  of course  she also knew
that every one who was good some day went back again to heaven

oh   she cried  in a hushed voice   has he gone back there

yes  dear   replied nurse evelyn gently   now  don t think of him any
more  here s a pretty book with pictures

but stella did think of him  a great deal more  the little golden haired
boy occupied her thoughts more than any one ever knew  and that night
and many other nights  when she looked upwards at the vast sky  so
mysterious and serene with its millions of stars  she would wonder and
ponder  and there was always one particular little star that she loved
best  and when she looked upon it a sweetness would steal into her
heart  and she would think of the gentle boy with the angel face  who
had gone back to heaven  for she felt quite sure that he was there
amongst them  and that he could see her  and that  perhaps  he loved
her

and all to herself she called him little starry  and she remembered him
always




cedric s unaccountable adventure

part i


cedric was flying his kite in a flowery meadow close to his home in
cornwall  it was a favourite spot of his  for he was a boy who loved
beautiful scenery  and from there he could get a glimpse of land s end
with its great rocks around which the waves frothed and gambolled
broke  and gurgled away

the day was grey and windy  just the sort of day for flying a kite  this
kite was of the old fashioned sort  with a tail of his own making  and
as it soared away higher and higher  with the tail wriggling its great
length like a happy eel on a holiday  his heart was full of pride and
content

he kept on unwinding and unwinding the large ball of string until he
began to wonder if his kite would still be in view by the time he had
unwound it all  the wind was increasing in strength  when  to his
astonishment  and apparently for no reason at all  the pull on his arm
suddenly relaxed  and the kite all at once dropped quickly to earth
tail first  cedric darted forward to where it lay  some distance ahead
when he reached it  he flung himself alongside to examine it carefully
he could find no rent  no damage  nothing was wrong  there was nothing
apparently  to account for such peculiar behaviour in his hitherto
well conducted kite

as he passed his hand over it where it lay  he felt underneath it
entangled in the tail  something hard  he could see it glistening
through  he quickly drew it forth  and found in his hand  a golden key

halloa  what s this   exclaimed cedric  as he knelt down and turned his
discovery over and over   a yellow key  however did it get there   was
his next thought  he continued to ask himself the riddle  but finding no
answer he gave it up  and carefully examined the key  there was no mark
on it  it wouldn t even whistle when he tried it   some one must have
lost it  i suppose   he went on  and concluded   well  it s no use to
me   and he threw it away  seating himself on the grass  he soon became
absorbed in getting his kite all trim again  and had temporarily secured
the string to a bush  when his attention was attracted by the key  which
lay and glistened as if it knew it was glistening

cedric didn t care to trouble with it  but instinctively he picked it
up  and said

i wonder where this key belongs to

at that moment his view of the land s end became slowly obscured by a
huge iron door  the lock of which was outlined with gold  he tried the
key he held   it fitted   a turn  the heavy door was unlocked  and he
put the key in his pocket  he turned the handle  pushed the door open
just enough to squeeze through  and it swung to behind him



there had been a great commotion in fairyland  the gnomes  who formed
the opposition party  had turned disloyal and wanted a republic
whereupon the king  hurt in his dignity  insisted upon abdicating  in
fact  he was tired of power  and glad of the excuse to resign  in spite
of the prayers and entreaties of those who desired him to remain in
office he returned to the treasury the golden key  together with the
crown and other royal jewels  and  to the concern of every one who
wasn t a gnome  went forth to play skittles  his sole interest and only
hobby

of all the regalia  the most precious object was the golden key  for
whoever held it was made king of fairyland by virtue of its possession
and it was ordained that it could only be parted with at the monarch s
free will  it could be surrendered  it could not be withdrawn

so the old king deposited it in the treasury  leaving his people  the
faithful and unfaithful alike  to fight out the matter as best they
could  in so doing they fought their very best  the quarrel between the
gnomes and the fairies waxed furious in their patriotic eagerness to get
their own way  but while blows were exchanged and relations were
otherwise strained  and the monarchists  generally speaking  were highly
annoyed  and the republicans were even more perturbed  the latter
suddenly lay low  and hatched an audacious plot  so daring was it that
it made their grotesque and stunted little bodies tremble as they
thought of it  and their gnarled feet shook in their shoes

this plot involved nothing less than the theft of the golden key  the
symbol of royalty was to be taken to the mountain top and flung far away
outside the boundaries of fairydom  and a republic proclaimed and
acclaimed  a monarchy could no longer be possible

meanwhile the guileless fairies  recking nothing of this  and rejoicing
in what they thought to be the discomfiture of their adversaries  chose
the popular crown princess for the succession  and began with much pomp
and circumstance the ceremony of investing her with the golden key
they had proceeded up to a certain point when  to their horror and
amazement  on opening the treasure chamber to bear the symbol in solemn
procession upon a velvet cushion  as the law demanded  they discovered
that  the golden key was gone

illustration   lay low  and hatched an audacious plot



cedric suddenly guessed that he possessed the key to fairyland  for he
found himself in a sun bathed valley with clouds of rainbow hues in the
azure sky above  in the distance he beheld a rippling lake of golden
water  on the borders of which stood a palace made of gems gathered from
the circling mountains which stood as sentinels around the valley  down
these mountains meandered little golden rills that fed the lake  nothing
stirred but gaily coloured birds  which fluttered amongst the blossoming
fruit trees and the rich and dainty flowers

all around the lake  as though from nowhere  sprang crowds of fairies
gnomes  pixies  and sprites  they were landing from the tiny
flower decked craft  forming processions  hurrying in and out of the
palace  presenting to cedric s astonished gaze a scene of wonderful
animation and pretty bustle  great preparations were apparently
proceeding

after a time they gathered together in waiting crowds  which stretched
a long distance on either side of the approach to the shimmering
edifice  and the words came to him with curious distinctness

hail  cedric  king of fairyland

k k king of fairyland   stammered the boy in bewilderment   am i king
of fairyland  you re only making fun  i ve only been flying my kite  i
can t be a king

of course your young majesty has got the key   remarked a funny little
old man at his elbow

yes   replied cedric  starting at the suddenness of the answer to his
question  but vastly surprised  and amused too  at the quaint way in
which he was addressed

very well  then  of course we all know you must have found it  or you
couldn t be here  i d far rather you had it than i  experience has
taught me that much  good morning  young gentleman  may it bring you
more pleasure than it brought me   and with a chuckle the little old man
bowed himself away

cedric had no time to think  for a gorgeous equipage stopped just in
front of him  the door flew open  the boy  guessing what was expected of
him  quickly stepped inside  and  wondering at this grandeur  the new
king of fairyland was borne swiftly through the serried ranks of his
bowing subjects to the doors of his magnificent palace  soldiers
presented arms  a national air was played on lutes and harps  and cedric
passed through the gates  followed by as many of the populace as had
tickets of admission to witness the most wonderful coronation you never
saw

illustration    of course your young majesty has got the key


part ii

in the throne room  on a throne of diamonds  cedric sat in royal robes
and on his head was a golden crown  which had been taken  as being about
his size  from the dome of the crown palace  grouped near him were the
aristocracy of fairyland  prominent among them the crown princess  and
her great friend and neighbour  the queen of gossamerland  both young
both beautiful  and both unmarried

when the ceremony was over  and the shout   hail  cedric  king of
fairyland   echoed once more  the boy  prompted by the lord high
chamberlain  rose and bowed his delighted acknowledgments  while the
crowds outside cheered for all they were worth  he kept standing  in
order to receive the general homage  with the quiet confidence of one
who had been used to that sort of thing every day of his life

little did he guess that the populace of fairyland  who were acclaiming
him  down to the tiniest sprite  were far from pleased to have a mortal
on their throne  that the gnomes were plotting   with  the fairies this
time  to depose him  for the key had come back to their land  and was
never likely to be stolen again  they had all put their heads together
how to make cedric part with it of his own free will  according to law
and they knew they had to accomplish their end by their wits  as no
other means held good  it was their desire now to elect their ruler by
putting the matter to the country to vote  and thus please both parties
the gnomes  who had had time to consider it  were dumbfounded at their
stupidity in having thrown the key into mortal land  and they regretted
it when it was too late

a fair lady  wearing a tiny crown  stepped forward and curtsied low
before her monarch  it was the crown princess  cedric wanted to detain
her  but it wasn t etiquette  and she smiled to herself as she swept
past with her maids of honour  she was followed by her dark friend  who
kissed cedric s hand  her face was more beautiful than any he had ever
beheld  in obedience to his wish that she should speak to him  the
little queen of gossamerland smiled and said

sire  i have often heard of mortals  but never saw one before  it is
said that some of them never dream of coming to our country  that others
often do  but they never come really  you know  your majesty is the
very first  will you graciously tell me how it feels

cedric laughed  and coughed nervously  and replied that  it felt very
pleasant and comfor ble

she turned her head as she withdrew  and whispered anxiously

do not part with the golden key   as you value your throne

the words  and still more the impressive and forceful manner  of the
dazzling little queen puzzled him  he determined  nevertheless  to
follow advice so fatefully given  but he couldn t help pondering over
it  and his face was graver as he bowed to the lords and ladies and
high born gnomes who had the honour of introduction

escorted by the whole of the brilliant company  king cedric left his
palace in order formally  to do some good deed   which was a part of the
ancient ceremonial  he was to open a new institution for fairies who had
lost their arts and crafts and livelihoods too  when they arrived at the
building it was announced that the key which was to have been presented
to him was not forthcoming  consternation  real or assumed    cedric
didn t believe in it   followed on the strange declaration of those who
were responsible for the carelessness  amid profuse apologies  the lord
high chamberlain begged the king that he would use the golden
key  which  being a master key  could of course take the place of any
other

acting on the advice given him  and alive to the evident importance of
retaining the key  which was also the key to his position   cedric
politely and graciously refused  at which there was considerable
sensation  arguments and persuasion were in vain  but at last he yielded
to the entreaties of those needy fairies who badly wanted their
institution  himself he inserted the key  which was found to fit  as was
to be expected  but when he wanted to withdraw it  it had stuck  and was
immovable  the lock had been carefully arranged that it should be so
triumph and amusement were on every face except his

i have been betrayed   muttered cedric  and he wondered what on
fairyland he should do next  there was silence  a breathless
interval  during which the boy never relaxed hold on his treasured
possession

cut away the lock   he commanded  at this order the people murmured
loudly  but soon fell into silence  for they were bound by their
constitution to obey their monarch  in a few moments the golden key was
again safe in cedric s pocket  and mistrust was in his heart  as it has
been in that of nearly every king who ever reigned

the coronation ceremony was over  and the company had dispersed  so
cedric found himself at liberty to saunter forth  he hadn t proceeded
more than a few yards in the brilliant landscape when a rabbit  renowned
for his white gloves  bounded up to him and humbly begged it might be
his majesty s pleasure to receive some famous members of animal
fairyland who were anxious to render homage  cedric replied royally with
a dignified nod  and followed the creature as it led the way to a
clearing in a forest close by  here  explained the rabbit  the animals
were allowed full liberty to say what they pleased  but beyond the
boundaries they were only able to make strange noises which their own
families alone could understand  it was thus that the secrets of
fairyland were kept from the world outside

upon a throne made from a cutting of the famous beanstalk grown for the
original jack king cedric seated himself  and awaited events

he hadn t long to wait  for a fox trotted up and bade him welcome to
animal fairyland  wonderfully tactful for his age  cedric told the fox
that he recognised him  having read about him in grimm s tales  and
remarked

you were so good  mr  fox  to the poor horse

at which the fox sniggered shyly and withdrew  this pleasing
reminiscence gave unbounded satisfaction to the various animals that had
quickly gathered around

cedric s inquiry of the wolf as to his digestion after that little
flirtation with red riding hood s grandmother was also considered
prodigiously appropriate  and was greeted with cordial appreciation  his
quick recognition  too  of the three bears added greatly to his
popularity  but he wasn t so happy in his remark to a stately swan who
came up and bowed

you re glad to have got rid of those ducks  i s pose   he observed

and pray  sire  where did you hear about that  it s a chapter of my
early history i hoped had never got about

oh  i have read all about the ugly duckling   replied cedric  persuaded
that the information would fill the swan with pride

why  you don t mean to say    do you  do you tell me that    screamed
the swan furiously  almost choked with indignation  and it could not
finish its sentences  then in a quieter  but still in an angry  voice
it continued   to think of it  why  i plumed myself on its having been
kept out of print  so that family scandal has got round after all   and
in defiance of all etiquette  the swan turned tail and waddled off

the audience is over   cried cedric indignantly

whereupon the deputation hastily withdrew

guide  sire   inquired a gnome  suddenly presenting himself and going
down on one knee   guide to the fairy ring

yes  please   and he followed him to where a number of peacocks stood
on guard with their tails magnificently spread

have you twopence   asked the guide anxiously

i m not sure   answered cedric  fumbling in his pocket

if not  i m afraid you can t be let in  sire   the gnome was looking
afraid that the king might not fall  after all  into the little trap he
was preparing

not let me in  can t i order myself through

no  paper  allowed  you can only be let in by paying the entrance fee

i never heard of a king paying twopence to go in anywhere   said
cedric  drawing himself up  he was not unreasonable  he felt  but he was
a little hurt in his dignity as sovereign

i m afraid your majesty can t go against the office of works

s pose i ordered the peacocks to be removed   said cedric  growing hot
at the undignified position of a monarch unable to produce the price of
a bath bun   s pose i ordered their necks to be wrung  or something

it would be deplorably irregular and excessively unconstitutional

cedric was taken at a disadvantage by the length of the words  but a
lucky discovery relieved him

here  i ve got four ha pennies  but i call it mean that i  of all
people  shouldn t be allowed in free

it s simply to show the person is well off  and to keep the place
select  it s the same for all  in the case of royalty the amount is
returned in cash at the end of the performance

cedric entered alone  and found the fairy ring far beyond anything he
could have dreamed of  thousands of little fairies  wearing cunning
arrangements of petals from the fruit blossoms  had joined hands and
were dancing round joyously  raising tiny clouds of yellow dust  which
enveloped them as with a golden mist  as he came in sight they burst
into song  and manoeuvring cleverly until he was in their midst  they
showed what they could do in grace of movement and harmony of sound
till  quite enchanted  he felt he could remain there for ever

go on  go on   he shouted  clapping his hands with delight  for the
little crew had come to a standstill

a pixie detached himself  and kneeling  begged his majesty to give him
the golden key

what for   asked cedric  surprised

to wind up the proceedings   came the reply of the fairies  who had
eagerly drawn near

can t   said cedric

do    said the prettiest of the fairies in chorus

hardly knowing what he was about  so much did he want to see the
entrancing dance all over again  he held out the key to the applicant
but  noticing a peculiar gleam dart from the pixie s eyes  he quickly
snatched it back again and replaced it in his pocket  and coming to
himself found that the peacocks were once more between him and the fairy
ring  that twopence was in his hand  and there was no one at all about
then he realised how narrow his escape had been   uneasy lies the head
that wears a crown   cedric knew that shakespeare had written that  but
he had never expected to learn the truth of it from experience

he lay on the grass  and pondered what he had better do in the trying
political situation   what s the use of being king of fairyland if i
have to be plotted against every hour of the day   muttered cedric
disconsolately

no use at all

they were the soft tones of the little queen of gossamerland  she sat
down next to him and put her tiny hand on his arm

what s to be done  then

it s very simple   she rejoined   give me the golden key  you ll be
king no longer  but you ll have no responsibilities or anxieties

that won t be much fun for me   replied cedric   besides  what will you
do with it

the right thing  i ll give it to the crown princess  the rightful heir
that will save the country a general election  and fairy tranquillity
will reign once more

why did you warn me not to part with it  and now you ask me for it

i wanted to get it myself as soon as you would give it up  so that i
might deliver it to my dear friend  who will become a queen like me
then she can choose her husband  and  after being her bridesmaid  i
suppose i shall be married too

will you marry me   asked cedric bluntly

why  you d have to live on honey   replied the gossamer queen  with a
smile  half sweet  half malicious  cedric turned it over in his mind
but not for long

give me the key   she begged coaxingly

yes  but   argued the boy   it s worth a lot  you know  i wouldn t so
much mind swopping it  but

the queen of gossamerland  tired of wasting time  put out her hand so
prettily  and pursed up her lips so sweetly and daintily  that he  did
give her the golden key  and she gave a kiss as a receipt  then she said
that the office of works would send for the crown  and flitted away

cedric prepared to remove his crown  with a sigh to think he had no
longer any right to it  but first he ran to the stream that slowly
floated by  and took a good look at himself  he smiled with pride   i
must say   he remarked confidentially to himself   i really do look
every inch a king  but  after all  i couldn t go to school with this
on  the fellows would be sure to notice it   he started at the bare
idea  and laid down the crown with a feeling of  good riddance  as
profound and grateful as ever king james ii  could have experienced  he
felt no other pang than that of dignity too quickly swept away

he placed it on the grass  confident that the gossamer queen would send
for it at once  and he began to think of his own return   now to find
that door   he exclaimed  and looked about him to ask the way  the
golden lake  the glittering palace  the sentry of mountains  all were
there  but no living being was in sight

queer place   i  call it   said cedric to himself   no cake shops  only
honey  and no policemen to tell the way   he wandered on in the hope of
coming sooner or later  somehow and somewhere  to the door

after a time he met the funny little old man who had accosted him on his
arrival  he was gazing hard at the boy  looking right through him as
though he were not there

will you kindly show me the door   said cedric eagerly

turn you out  do you mean   asked ex king the first

i want to turn myself out  if i can   replied cedric

already  good morning  young gentleman  ex king the second  there s a
pair of us

please show me the door

when is a door not a jar   asked the out o  work sovereign

don t ask me riddles  show me the door   ordered cedric in his best
royal command manner  and looked so threatening that the little old man
quickly pointed over his shoulder

cedric walked off in that direction without a word  and to his joy he
discovered the door just a little way in front of him

thank goodness   he exclaimed  as he ran up to it  and then he suddenly
realised that he no longer possessed the golden key with which to open
it  how was he to escape  he turned and looked back at what now was
an immeasurable distance  so very far away did it seem  and there was
once more bustling activity about the palace  another coronation
ceremony was beginning all over again

illustration    i really do look every inch a king

the boy flung himself against the door  and banged and kicked at it with
all his might  it was of no use

oh  the key  the key   he cried   if they would only spare it from
their silly triumphing for a moment  and let me out

he put his eye to the keyhole  and with longing gaze he saw his kite on
the spot he had left it  with its lazy tail gently stirred by the
breeze

once more he looked back  despairing of help  the same animated fairy
scene met his gaze  all so indifferent to his helplessness  grasping the
handle of the door in his hand he shook it in desperation

then he remembered  he quietly turned the handle  and walked out

the sea breeze blew freshly as cedric freed his kite from the bush  and
when he looked back there was land s end just as he had seen it before
and fairyland s end  too   he muttered  for all trace of the iron door
had disappeared after he passed through  he stared in astonishment  and
couldn t make it out  and the adventure remained a mystery all the days
of his life




rosella


rosella

yes  mother   and a dark eyed little girl looked down over the
banisters into the hall

i want you to get ready quickly and go to the moat house  and persuade
grandfather to come back with you this afternoon instead of waiting
until the evening

but if he invites me to tea with him

don t stay  dearie  i want you back before dusk  and it gets dark so
soon now  and you must help me to tie the crackers on the
christmas tree  it s still sunny  so make haste

in a few minutes the child was tripping downstairs  smart and cosy in
her red coat  hat  and muff  with all the importance of her nine years

go the shortest way  you know  keep to the path across the moor
continued her mother   or you might fall over bits of rock under the
snow

do you know  mother  i always wonder  when there s snow  where all the
grass is and what s underneath  all killed by the freeze

oh no  the snow keeps everything nice and warm   replied her mother
with a kiss

davis  the portly butler  advanced and opened the front door

being  above  the snow doesn t keep  me  nice and warm  mother   called
back rosella as she ran laughing down the steps into the icy north wind
which blew her dark hair out to its full length and heightened the warm
colour in her cheeks

make haste  and you ll be there in half an hour   mrs  silverton
returned to her boudoir  and standing at the bow window followed with
loving eyes the graceful little red figure  until at a bend in the road
it turned  gaily waved a farewell  and was lost to sight

when rosella reached the moor the high wind was against her  blowing her
frock between her knees and making her eyes water   this way will be
very difficult and unpleasant   she thought to herself   i d far rather
go round by the hill  and then  too  i could see if grandfather has got
the snow castle on the top finished and ready for to morrow  i forgot
about that when mother said to go across the moor  i should so like to
see it  i wonder if i might

she stood irresolute for a moment  then left the straight path and
started running  in order to save time  in the other direction  thus
making for the hill which she intended to climb

the sun became obscured  and what was worse  down from the leaden yellow
sky tiny snowflakes began to flutter as though in play  rapidly
increasing in size and volume until  as if by magic  rosella found
herself enveloped in a blinding snowstorm that obscured the landscape
and decided her to return home  but returning home was not so easy as
turning herself round  and she soon had the growing conviction that no
matter which way she turned she was lost  utterly lost  for all that she
could see was that she no longer seemed to be dressed in red  but was
thickly coated in white

twice she tripped over the uneven ground  but she stumbled along
hopefully and bravely  and even tried to sing  only the snowflakes got
into her mouth and made her shut it up tight

rosella had no idea where she was  and she felt very tired  how she
wished now she had gone straight forward  there would have been no
difficulty about that  by good luck she came close up to a large piece
of overhanging rock  she did not remember ever seeing it before  so she
was more than ever confused as to the whereabouts of the hill or of
anything  but it was good for shelter  she placed her muff in a niche
above her head  and sat down to rest awhile and consider what she had
best do

the wind howled around her only partially sheltered retreat  and
myriads of snowflakes  drifting in  fell softly about her  creeping
closer and closer  covering her boots  lying thickly on her frock  on
her shoulders  drifting  too  into her eyes and making them blink  and
powdering her hair with white  and she felt too cold to think  too cold
to move



after a while rosella exclaimed   this won t do  i must get up from
here  it s such a dreadfully cold place   and she determined to try and
go on  if only to keep herself warm  so she shook herself  took down her
muff  and went forth

it was snowing as much as ever  but rosella found that the ground was no
longer flat  she was on the hillside  and as she climbed she wondered
anxiously how she should know which side to come down  once she was on
the top  in order to find the moat house  then she smiled as it occurred
to her how much she must now look like the tiny  red hooded  toy figure
in the glass paper weight at home which showed itself enveloped in a
miniature snowstorm when it was shaken  she plodded on higher and
higher

the weather was clearing when rosella stood on the summit of the hill
and she was lost in admiration as she gazed at the largest  grandest
snow castle she could never have imagined  before it  too  stood a snow
man splendidly proportioned and set up  to her intense astonishment  as
she timidly approached he bowed politely

rosella curtsied instinctively  then laughed as she went round to see
where he had broken  but he wasn t broken at all  for he turned too
faced her  and said

i need hardly introduce myself  rosella  i presume you recognise king
frost when you meet him in any guise  you wished to see my castle  and
gave yourself a polite invitation  you are welcome

she was so taken aback with the suddenness of all this that she could
find no words for reply  so she made another  much lower  curtsey  which
she knew to be correct in the presence of royalty  then she took his
proffered arm  and the tall white figure and the little white figure
mounted the white steps  went through the massive gateway  and proceeded
down a long  narrow passage lighted with a ruddy glow from the high
windows  which were glazed with something red  transparent  and
glistening  it was much warmer here  and rosella noticed that the snow
had melted from her clothes  and that her companion also appeared to be
dressed in red  his white face with its white beard and white hair wore
quite a jovial air  and on top of it was set a crown of carved ice that
reminded her of their chandelier in the drawing room

he did the honours by offering her some snow broth  which she declined
then she thought she ought to say something  so she remarked  with a
touch of family pride

i had no idea that grandfather had built such a fine place as this

i  think the credit is entirely mine   protested her companion with an
amused chuckle    i  provide the material  you see  or there would have
been no  fine place  at all  see my point

yes  your majesty   she assented  for she knew it wasn t polite to
argue  especially with a royal personage

this way   he exclaimed  and led her down another passage on the right
and halted to push open a swing door of ice a little way  and genially
patted her on the cheek  which was kindly meant no doubt  but his touch
nipped her with cold so that she shivered

i shall be on guard outside  if you want me  call me   almost as soon
as she heard the words the heavy door swung to behind her  and she found
herself alone in a great  white  glistening hall with high arches open
to the air  evidently it was scarcely snowing now  for only little
isolated flakes came fluttering in  but in their falling they changed
into little shadowy girls and boys in white  who danced playfully around
her  and their cold white draperies swept lightly about her face
reminding her of the blinding snowstorm she had passed through  but she
only wanted to get away to her grandfather now

rosella sheltered her face with her muff and ran the gauntlet of the
persistent little snowflakes  in a corner she espied a spiral staircase
which seemed to lead up into one of the battlemented towers she had
noticed outside  and she imagined it a way of escape  so up she ran  the
steps were very slippery  but she got up to the top  where  through a
narrow loophole  she saw king frost down below  standing there just as
she first saw him when she thought him only a snow man  more anxious
than ever to know how to get to her grandfather  she called out

your majesty   and repeated loudly the two words over and over again
for he either would not or could not hear her  and what was very
curious  there was an echo which called back  rosella  rosella   in the
same anxious tone

talking was clearly of no use  she must do something  so she tried to
squeeze her muff through the aperture in order to drop it on his head
and attract his attention  but it would not go through  it stuck there
and closed out her view  try as she would she could not release it  and
with a gulp in her throat she realised she would have to leave it  her
hands grew terribly cold without it  and it was too draughty to remain
there

from the landing on which she stood steps led up higher  so she
proceeded to explore  and found herself in an octagonal turret chamber
i suppose it serves me right  and i  am  lost   and  there s no one to
help me   sighed rosella

oh yes there is

whose voice is that   she asked  she could see no one  but at the same
moment a sunbeam pierced through an aperture  pointed straight at what
appeared to be a lift behind a slender column  and then faded away  it
was  a lift  made of ice and snow  as was everything else in the
castle  rosella entered it and took a seat  the lift at once began
gently and slowly to go down  down  first into the foundations of the
castle  and then into the interior of the hill right down under the
snow  till it stopped in a grotto lined with cobwebs and suffused with a
mysterious green light  there was a soft  singing sound  as though made
by the wind  in front was a frozen lake  and the ice of it was green
from the same strange light

i must try and find my way to grandfather   said rosella vaguely as
she wandered about the grotto  looking about her for a way out



mrs  silverton kept glancing anxiously at the clock and at the
snowstorm  davis entered   madam   said he  with an usually solemn face
mr  silverton has telephoned again from the moat house that miss
rosella hasn t arrived

then she must have lost her way   exclaimed her mother  now thoroughly
alarmed   though i don t see how she could  keeping straight across the
moor to the moat house gate at the end of the path  we must set out
davis  and find her

difficult this weather  madam  if our young lady is lost on the moor

is it still so bad

the storm s not so thick as it was  i ll go immediately  there s no
time to be lost  to my thinking  madam

yes  we ll go at once  davis

mrs  silverton  pale with anxiety  sent other messengers in various
directions  and then started off herself  on the moor she met another
search party headed by old mr  silverton and his faithful collie dog
and the moor rang with anxious cries of  rosella  rosella   uttered by
whitened shadowy figures that looked like phantoms in the falling snow



i  must  try and find my way to grandfather   repeated rosella
falteringly  realising that she didn t know in the least how to proceed
she never had a notion that a snow castle was so intricate inside  with
a hall  a lift  a grotto  and things  indeed  she had always imagined
for no particular reason that it had no inside at all   but of course
she now argued   if it has an outside it  must  have an inside  or it
wouldn t be an outside   but it was much more startling when she looked
up and found that she was by no means alone  the cobwebs were all
inhabited  inhabited  not by ugly spiders  but by the wee est little
baby fairies with the wee est gossamer wings  swaying in their cobweb
hammocks in all attitudes  fast asleep  soothed by the lullaby hummed by
the wind

this must be where they are bred   cried rosella  in an ecstasy of
admiration and delight

this is fairy spring s nursery   explained a beautiful sprite
appearing suddenly at her elbow like a little bright sunbeam   king
frost is the ground landlord  you know  and allows all her young things
to sleep here and keep warm

and who are you  please   inquired the sprite s young visitor

i am love of goodwill  and my father s name is christmas

i know you by name quite well  and am so glad to see you  perhaps you
would kindly help me to find my way

if you keep on going to the right  when you see the snowdrops  mother
there you will find your landmark

oh  do please tell me more clearly  what did you say  tell me where
i   but rosella was again alone in the green grotto with the sleeping
baby fairies in their swaying hammocks  and the soft music of the wind
surely there can t be any grown up snowdrops at christmas  it s too
early   and i shall be losing my way for weeks   continued rosella
nevertheless  she kept on turning to the right through upward passages
first of rock  then of sand  in which were embedded deep growing roots
then of soil with its minerals  broken up leaves  and corpses of insects
which she didn t like at all  then through a passage lined with true red
soil  where little grubs were lying fast asleep in their nests

you ugly grubby little things   remarked rosella as she passed them

they are only lying low at present  they will be lovely painted ladies
and visit the court of fairy spring   replied love of goodwill  hovering
again at her side   and look  there are the baby snowdrops asleep in
their earthy cots  they  too  will awake soon and get up  i helped their
mother to get up as she was in such a hurry to see the world  i m
afraid she will have got nipped by king frost for her impatience
farewell  i must go and see what is happening

rosella followed the sunbeam  into which the sprite had vanished  and at
once felt the keen air blowing on her face  and knew she was above
ground once more  everything was all white again  she sat down upon a
piece of rock to rest  and noticed the sunbeam pointing straight at a
little woe begone snowdrop sticking up out of the snow before her  and
to her joy the snow man was close by calling  rosella  rosella   in the
echo s anxious tone she had heard before  so he must have wanted her
then  badly

yes  your majesty   she murmured

he bent over her kindly   there  little lady   he continued   drink some
of this now   and something cold yet stinging was poured gently down her
throat

thank you  your majesty  i did feel tired and queer  but your snow
broth has made me all right   she said it quite gratefully  then her
eyes opened wide and she cried in amazement

grandfather  why it s  you   you were the snow man all the time  and
look  there s my muff up there that i left in the wall

but for that sticking up we might never have found our little
treasure   replied old mr  silverton  he picked her up and  holding her
aloft  showed her to her anxious mother  who came hurrying on the scene

don t shiver so  dearie   exclaimed mrs  silverton  passionately
embracing the child  as hot tears dropped on her daughter s face   you
must be perished with cold  but this nice sunshine which has come out
now will do you good

i didn t feel cold  it was quite nice and warm under the snow as you
said  mother  and so wonderful

davis carried her home in triumph at the head of the procession  and
after precautionary remedies had been taken  rosella sat cosily tucked
up in the big arm chair in front of the huge log fire  thinking over all
she had seen  of course she confessed to her temptation to go astray
and was readily forgiven  then  as mr  silverton insisted he had never
in his life been any one else but himself  rosella gaily recounted her
meeting with the snow man at his snow castle   and king frost said
grandfather   concluded rosella   that the credit of the castle was his
for providing the snow and not yours

bless my soul   cried old mr  silverton   and he was right there
because i ve had nothing to do with any snow castle or any snow
man  there was some talk  but nothing came of it

but i was king frost s visitor there  don t you see   insisted rosella
smiling   so i know that s only one of your jokes  grandfather

he smiled too and wiped his spectacles

the next morning rosella volunteered to fetch her grandfather and
introduce him to king frost  so the two climbed the hill  but no vestige
of snow castle or snow man was there

there  you see   said her grandfather  laughing  as he genially patted
her on the cheek  how cold his hand felt  it nipped her with cold  so
that she shivered  yet the weather had changed  and it was more like a
sunny day in spring than in midwinter

she left old mr  silverton at his gate  and he assured her with a kiss
that he wasn t a bit disappointed at the wonderful disappearance  but
that it was all certainly a very remarkable affair indeed

rosella thought so too  then she turned and walked thoughtfully home




the cuckoo that lived in the clock house


it was rather a ramshackle  badly built wooden house  in which the
cuckoo lived  outside it looked smart enough  but inside  repairs were
badly needed  it had been handed down from father to son  and over the
front door  which was at the top of the house  stood a beautifully
carved statue of their ancestor  sir cuckoo de cuckoo

the clock house was situated not far from the dolls  house  backed by a
flowery wall in a small department of nursery land ruled over by robert
and lucy  lucy was ground landlady of the clock house  and it was her
daily privilege to wind up its affairs

no one ever knocked at the cuckoo s front door  because it had no
number  there was a round dozen of numbers in the immediate
neighbourhood  the pendulum  whose tongue never ceased to wag once it
was wound up  remarked  that two firm hands were required to keep things
in order  as to the chains  they regularly got weighed down under the
strain of responsibility  and a heavy weight it was

so  as one could not summon the cuckoo at will  the only thing to do was
to wait and see it when it chose to appear  and then  as likely as not
if nobody was about  robert would seize the opportunity to take
pot shots at it with his pea shooter  so far he had invariably missed
sometimes it kept an appointment with him punctually at the hour
sometimes it didn t  occasionally  it came out at odd times  and then
remained indoors altogether  when that happened for a more than usually
long period  it was sure to be because the poor cuckoo felt indisposed
in its bellows  and when it became apparent that something had gone
wrong with the inmate of the clock house  an entrance had to be effected
by the back door and a dose of oil administered  whereupon the front
door would fly open and the cuckoo appear again on the threshold  it
never ventured further  bow to the multitude  or to empty space  and
pipe  cuc  koo   just as many times as it felt inclined at the moment

one fine afternoon in spring  when the cuckoo came out punctually  and
went through its performance of three bows with a cuckoo call after each
salutation  there happened to be a fresh inmate all alone in the
nursery  this was tabiatha  the new kitten  cosily reposing in her new
basket under the table   aha  poultry   mewed tabiatha  lying low
opening a lazy but watchful eye  and gazing upwards   bless my tail
you re a tender morsel  i ll be bound  small  but a tit bit   so thought
the kitten  with an increasing feeling of longing in the chest  it had
sounded to tabiatha like an echo of the call she had heard so recently
in the lane near the old farm at home

i don t want to pop out any more   said the cuckoo after re entering
the clock house   i m bored to tears   and it settled down in a corner
and looked very melancholy   what with that horrid boy  robert  lurking
about  and now a kitten of all things  why  life s not worth the living
if ever i do pop out again  i should like to pop out for good and
all  stretch my wings and fly away  right away  and see something of the
world

work  that s the cure for all woes   solemnly ticked the pendulum
look at me  i m always at it  with a good swinging stride   the hands
didn t explain their views  they were keeping far apart  and were not on
speaking terms   every one is expected to do his duty   urged the
pendulum

that was only meant for one day  not morning  noon  and night   argued
the cuckoo   it s all very well for a wagtail like you  but for a cuckoo
with a soul above it  especially with a fine  well trained voice

every one must do his duty at all times  yes  look at me  but i fear
you can t see me  do you follow me   asked the pendulum jokingly
getting no reply  it ticked tacked on  until the cuckoo felt quite
distracted



listen to me  children   said their mother  entering the nursery  when
playtime had begun   nurse has gone to lie down  she isn t very well
this afternoon  so at four o clock put everything away neatly  then make
yourselves tidy  and come downstairs  where you may have tea with me

robert and lucy said they were sorry for nurse  but they smiled  and
hopped about with delight at the treat of tea downstairs  they promised
to do as they were told  and with muffled footsteps hurried on the
landing to open the gate and let their mother out of their domain  and
quietly closed it to keep themselves in  then they settled down in the
nursery to  loto   but as lucy always won  robert tired of it  card
houses didn t answer either  because it amused robert not to build them
but to shake the table when lucy s structures were in course of
erection

their mother  busily writing in the drawing room  began to wonder why
the children didn t come downstairs  and tea was just being brought in
when suddenly screams and cries were heard issuing from the nursery  and
she rushed upstairs in alarm

there she found the nursery littered with things  chairs in unusual
places  some overturned  and lucy lying on the floor crying  with a cut
on her lip  which was bleeding  robert had both stockings torn  and was
ruefully rubbing his knees  the little girl was more frightened than
hurt

whatever has happened  robert   exclaimed their mother as she helped
lucy to her feet  and comforted her

i was hunting   he began to explain   and she was the gazelle  and i
was chasing her from rock to rock

jumping from the table on to the chairs and back again   added lucy in
further explanation   and we both tumbled down

serve you both right for being so disobedient as to jump on the
furniture   replied their mother  with placid satisfaction that matters
were no worse   you ought to have been all tidied up  and downstairs by
now

it isn t time yet  surely  mother   the three turned instinctively
towards the cuckoo clock  it had stopped at three minutes to four

there now  lucy  you silly   cried her brother   if you hadn t
forgotten to wind it up  we shouldn t have had that beastly tumble  and
shouldn t have been late for tea

come  dears  quickly  and i ll help make you ready   said their mother
and they left the nursery together



during the excitement tabiatha had remained unnoticed in her basket
under the table  glad in all the turmoil to be peaceful and forgotten
she came out  stretched herself lazily  and soon began to gambol about
the room  the clock chain  lying loosely on the ground  attracted her
attention  she crouched  then leapt at one bound upon it  backed a
little  touched it with her paw  lay on her side  and played with the
bright links with all four paws and much enjoyment  with a sudden
movement she righted herself  made a spring upwards  missed the chain
and fell without hurt  liking this novel game  she leapt higher next
time  and alighted on a cushioned chair  scratched her way up  jumped on
to a bookcase  and then on to an empty shelf  there was the chain within
easy reach  putting out her paw  it caught instead in a ring she hadn t
noticed  to disentangle it she reached over  lost her foothold  and
still caught in the ring  found that the rattling chain was moving
downwards with her weight until it deposited her gently on the ground
greatly to her surprise  again she scrambled up the furniture in the
same way  her paw was now on both chains  suddenly something swung
backwards and forwards

tic  tac

tabiatha was for the moment dismayed  and  arching her back  she stood
rooted to the spot

tic  tac

it came unpleasantly close to her  nearly touching her nose each time
but she never budged an inch  whr r r r r

cuc  koo  cuc  koo  cuc  koo  cuc

tabiatha  rising to the occasion  and quick to seize an opportunity or
anything else  took her last and only chance  she seized the poultry
with both paws  crack  snap  she lost her balance and fell down  down
on to the cushioned chair  the cuckoo flew into the air  alighted on
tabiatha s back  and bounded on to the ground  tabiatha forgot at once
her escape from breaking her neck  sprang after the cuckoo lying there
turned it over  paused  sniffed  found to her surprise that it was not
good to eat  that it hadn t even feathers  and was only made of wood
turned it over again  and began tapping it and pouncing on it until
suddenly forgetting all about it  she cantered away sideways with her
tail curling in the air  she jumped into her basket  rolled herself up
soon purred herself fast asleep  and looked the very picture of helpless
innocence

the cuckoo  out in the world at last  having recovered from its first
alarm at the useless stiffness of its wings  waited for something to
happen  as nothing did happen  it thought the world a very dull and
stupid place  and concluded that  after all  work was better than lying
there helpless  idle  motionless  and ridiculous  what was the use of
its trained voice now  it couldn t articulate a sound even to summon
help  it had no idea of the time  but the sun was shining brightly when
at last it found itself carefully lifted and placed on a higher level



when lucy entered the nursery that morning  soon after robert  he
exclaimed

i say  lucy  there s something fresh for breakfast  look on your
plate

oh  my poor cuckoo   she cried in distress   you ve shot it at last
you bad boy  i shan t love you ever any more

but she did love him at once again  for it was a fact that no one knew
how ever the cuckoo came to be lying on the floor in the remote corner
where nurse had picked it up  the cushioned chair was in its place
again  a long way off the clock  every one was mystified  and could not
imagine how it had happened  but tabiatha knew all about it  though you
would never have guessed it from her round  innocent eyes as she sat
licking first one velvety paw  and then the other velvety paw  as though
she were washing them of any share in the mischief

when the clock house was spring cleaned  and the cuckoo duly set there
on its legs again  it formed the firm determination to remain at its
post in the future  and  with its clock house in order  it worked ever
after with regularity and good humour just like one o clock

christmas at the court of king jorum


the great evening had come  and every one in cosmopolis castle was agog
with excitement  eight months before  the monarch had by royal herald
extraordinary announced his intention of making known his decision on
christmas eve  and christmas eve had come  no wonder every one was agog
with excitement  because king jorum was at last going to announce which
of the lovely ladies of the court should be raised to the position of
the late queen  his defunct consort  she  poor soul  had possessed
neither charm nor beauty  and without her he had been quite happy for
the past two years  surrounded by smiling faces and kept constantly
amused by the ladies and gentlemen of his court

he had a jovial nature  and was an indulgent father to his two young
daughters  especially fond of the younger  princess veronica  for more
delightful sweetness  prettiness  and lovableness it would be difficult
to find in any other young damsel of sixteen years old  so believed that
fine young soldier  prince olivin  and so believed every one else in
the whole kingdom  every one else  with one exception  princess
christobel  her sister  older by one year  she had her own ideas on the
subject evidently  for she kept a surly silence when her sister s
praises were sung  people said it was her jealousy  because she was
plain looking  and sulky in expression and character  and some did say
she was secretly in love with prince olivin herself

outside the castle this night the silent landscape had been decorated
by order of king frost  in snow and crystal  inside the castle the great
halls had been decorated  by order of king jorum  in holly and
mistletoe  in the antechamber to the ball room stood the giant
christmas tree  hung with so many gifts of exquisite needlework from the
ladies of the court for the king  and so many  too  for princess
veronica  that there was hardly room for any other presents for any one
else  so they had to be stacked up in separate heaps on the floor

there was one present on the tree  which was handsomer and costlier than
all the rest  it was a pair of woollen boots so cunningly and
dexterously wrought with precious jewels that they were the most
beautiful ever seen or heard of  they were the handiwork of countess
spinx  and of all the handsome ladies who were assembled in the
ball room where the candles in the chandeliers cast a softening light
on their charms  she seemed this christmas eve the most unnerved  the
most excited  courtiers came strolling in by twos and threes  and the
scene became animated and gay

for as history shows  it was the custom at the court of king jorum  by
special decree of the monarch  that every man  woman  and child should
dress themselves in costumes of any distinctive style they
liked  whatever suited their fancy best   that was the origin  ages
after  of the term  fancy dress   there was thus no slavish following of
fashion  and consequently every one looked  or fancied they looked
their very  very best  and were thoroughly at ease in their quaint and
mostly  fascinating attire

here s little love   exclaimed a bevy of fair dames  pressing forward
as a handsome child stepped into their midst  dressed as cupid  and
looking the realest of little loves from the tips of his tiny bare toes
to the tips of his tiny bare wings  he was the king s godson and pet

he s sure to know  perhaps he can give us a hint of the news
exclaimed countess spinx with eyes blazing eagerly as she placed herself
in his path  with her crook firmly planted on the ground  she was
dressed as a shepherdess  which showed to advantage the curls on her
fair neck  and her small feet in their high heeled shoes   whisper to
me   she coaxed   or   with a pretty shake of the crook   i ll not let
you pass

little love might have been deaf  looking neither to the right nor to
the left  so unconcernedly did he continue his way stolidly on to meet
the procession of the king

countess spinx bit her lip in vexation  the other ladies merely shrugged
their shoulders and laughed  and the gentlemen stroked their mouths to
hide their smiles  then all conversation was smothered by the entry of
the heralds with their raised silver trumpets and their

par   parraparpar   pip   ha
par   parraparpar   paar    r

this was immediately followed by the entry of king jorum holding little
love by the hand  the whole company bowed and curtsied very low  and
then stood at attention  breathless with expectation

king jorum was a very big man  with a very big smile  and very big
woollen boots  he always wore woollen boots because  being his own
commander in chief  he liked to stand at ease  so he said  naturally in
a very big voice

according to my promise it is now my pleasure to announce to my court
here assembled my decision with regard to your future queen  after
prolonged thought and study of face and character i have come to the
conclusion that there is not one lady of my court but who is quite
lovely enough and charming enough to become my royal consort  therefore
to choose is difficult  so difficult that it is impossible  and  being
impossible  i shall never wed again  i have spoken

illustration   looking neither to the right nor to the left

for a moment there was intense silence  then deafening cheers arose  and
all faces were radiant with delight  especially the faces of the ladies
who thus remained equals  no jealousy being possible   such tact   said
one   how true   cried another  but one lady had slipped away
unobserved  it was countess spinx

the gallant monarch  unaccompanied  pleased at the reception given to
his declaration  smilingly passed on to the antechamber  as was his
wont  for a private view of the christmas tree before the revels
commenced  king jorum had detached one of the woollen boots embroidered
with pearls and precious stones  anxiously tried it on  and was admiring
the effect  when little love appeared and inquired if he would grant an
interview to prince olivin  who was waiting without

i am engaged   was his majesty s impatient reply

that  sire  is what prince olivin wants to be

eh  what s that  put on this other boot for me   he unfastened it from
the tree   ha  that s very smart  very attentive of the dear countess
now show him in

the two young princesses had not made their appearance for the
proclamation  they  as well as little love  had been in the king s
confidence  and they did not intend to be present  however  as the hour
of the revels was fast approaching  veronica feared that her sister
would be late as usual  so she took her last glance at herself in the
mirror  tightened the blue ribbon that was threaded through her fair
hair  tucked a pale rose in the blue sash of her high waisted  white
muslin frock  and flitted off happily to christobel s room

come in   said a not very amiable voice in response to the light tap
oh  it s you  is it

can i help you  as you have no maid

princess christobel s room was by no means tidy   i don t want any
help   she replied ungraciously  moving some of the garments that
littered the bed   but you can sit down there  if you like  next to the
shah of persia

veronica took the place indicated next to the sweetest little blue
persian kitten that was curled up fast asleep on the coverlet

i like your new frock  veronica   continued christobel  surveying her
sister as she pinned up her black hair without troubling even to do it
before a glass   but you look pretty in anything  if you didn t  no one
would trouble to pet you  no one ever fusses over me

papa does  for one

only because he thinks it s his duty

i would if you d let me

oh yes  you d be very pleased if i d let you hang about me  an ugly
girl can t show to much advantage next to a pretty one  i know your
little game

oh  christobel  how can you say such unkind  unjust things   protested
poor veronica with a sob

if you want to cry   said christobel crossly   you shouldn t do so
until you go to sleep  you cry so easily  and then your bright eyes look
heavy  and your aquiline nose gets red  and the whole castle gets upset
about them  who cares if  my  eyes are red

every one  of course  besides  one s looks aren t everything

i know differently  looks  are  everything  but i don t care if people
trouble about me or not  or anything they do  or think  or say

what  are  you putting on  christobel  not  that   surely

yes  same old red riding hood cape and green skirt  does for indoors or
out  same old crew about  i suppose

i suppose so  but it s christmas eve  those loose things don t even
suit you  let me lend you a new frock which i have  just the same as
this  we can arrange ribbons of your colour  red  we re the same height
and it will suit you quite as well as it suits me

a nice comparison people would draw  eh   sneered christobel  and being
ready she took the sleepy shah in her arms and stalked downstairs with
him faintly mewing his protests  leaving her sister to follow if she
liked

in the ball room christobel superciliously took no notice of the
respectful greetings of the court  she was naturally shy  reserved too
and sensitive as to her appearance and lack of charm  but veronica had a
kind word for every one  stopping to greet with a smile or a merry jest
all present  for they all adored her for her sweetness  graciousness
and extraordinary beauty  there wasn t a man but who would have died for
her  nor a woman but who felt better for her radiant presence  little
love suddenly appeared and whispered something to princess veronica  who
blushed  was confused  and said in a low voice to her sister

prince olivin is here  papa has sent for me

you might have told me he was coming   replied christobel  turning
pale

but i never knew  indeed   her sister had turned away  and little love
was leading veronica towards the antechamber

it seemed to princess christobel as though every face in the ball room
was a mask  and behind that mask were eyes that gleamed with
mockery  that she had only to turn her back  and fingers of scorn and
derision would mark her passage  and she turned and fled  never pausing
in her course through the long passages and up the marble stairway until
she was back in her room  where she flung the poor shah and herself on
the bed and burst into a torrent of tears and lamentations in her
loneliness  disappointment  and jealousy  the kitten  too  looked
unusually blue  and mewed disconsolately  felt bored  then purred
stretched its little self on the coverlet  and fell asleep again  before
long the sound of the heralds  silver trumpets pierced right up into
christobel s ears

par   parraparpar   pip   ha
par   parraparpar   paar    r

and she knew that the engagement was then being announced of princess
veronica to prince olivin  and the strains of the waltz of the
affianced which followed  played by the court musicians  confirmed the
fact

how long she remained thus in the dark she did not know  sounds of an
angry voice roused her from her stupor  and she went out into the
brilliantly lighted corridor  shading her eyes from the glare  the scent
of flowers and the soft strains of music becoming more noticeable as she
approached the stairway whence the voices proceeded  one of which she
could now distinguish as being that of her sister  she peeped over the
banisters  and saw  standing close beside veronica  countess spinx
white with suppressed passion

you knew   hissed the countess   that there was to be no queen

i and my sister knew  yes  let me pass  i don t know what s become of
her  i want to fetch her

you might have told it to your old friend  you are looking radiantly
beautiful to night

i am very happy

happy with your betrothed

yes

listen  did you know that every one said  i  had the best chance of
being queen

you   exclaimed the young princess in astonishment   fancy young you my
stepmother   and she burst out into a merry laugh  the next moment she
was falling headlong down the marble stairway  and then lay quite still
bruised and bleeding  in the stillness that ensued  for the music had
stopped  countess spinx flew upstairs  where she was confronted by
princess christobel  who pushed roughly past her and hurried down to her
sister s side  her screams for help brought people running from every
side  the injured girl  still unconscious  was quickly borne to her
apartments  and the court physicians surrounded her

all sorts of rumours were set afloat in the castle  but all that was
gathered for certain by the company  as they dispersed  was that
princess veronica slipped on the marble stair owing to her new
high heeled shoes  that the sweet face was strapped and bandaged  for it
was all cut and bruised  that the nose was broken  and her beauty spoilt
for ever  prince olivin was half wild with grief  and poor king jorum
was shedding tears all alone in his study when christobel sought
admittance  her face was set and stern  and the sight of his weakness
didn t unnerve her as she said bluntly

father  veronica did not slip on the stair  she was purposely and
viciously thrown down

eh   what    exclaimed the king  staring at her   are you taking leave
of your senses  there s not a soul who would hurt my pretty darling
you have enemies  she has none

she  was happy  others were not  countess spinx was in a fury of
disappointment at not being chosen queen  she flung poor veronica down
in spite and malice  i saw her do it

the king bounded up   summon the countess   he cried

before her christobel repeated her accusation  and countess spinx tried
to assert she only put out her arms to save the unfortunate princess
from slipping  further questioned  she got confused  contradicted
herself  and finally sunk on her knees and prayed for mercy

to the cells   shouted the king  and his eyes falling on his jewelled
boots  he hastily tore them off and threw them after her as she was
carried away

when  next day  poor little princess veronica recovered consciousness
and was free from pain she asked for her sister  who came quickly to her
side

have you heard   asked veronica faintly   that i  i  i am maimed for
life  with a broken nose and scarred face i shall not only be ugly but
repulsive

poor veronica  you will then be on the same level with me in the
future  how you will miss all the petting  all the love

i suppose my life is spoilt  and when i had beauty  i thought of it and
prized it so little  but won t you love me  christobel

yes  i will now

why only now

because i shall always feel sorry for you  i have never felt sorry for
any one but myself before  and i shall love you heaps and heaps

don t you think others may feel sorry for me  too   poor prince olivin
poor me   she added with a little moan

christobel shook her head sadly   beauty is everything  you will
understand that now

no limbs were broken  and in a couple of days princess veronica  with
her head and face veiled in white lace  was able to receive some visits
of sympathy in her misfortune

king jorum was inconsolable  and whenever he came out of the invalid s
room he would vow terrible threats of vengeance on countess spinx  who
was trembling for her spiteful life in the cells

on the third night after the christmas festivities had been brought to
their sudden and tragic close  princess christobel dreamed such a vivid
dream that it awakened her  she dreamed that little love  who avoided
her whenever he could  came smilingly up to her  kissed her hand  and
raising a letter he held  showed  with a look of triumph which puzzled
her  that it was addressed to her sister  she awoke  and instantly
remembered that little love had really kissed her hand that evening  to
her great surprise  she sat up in bed listening  for she fancied she
heard her sister call  becoming anxious for her comfort  she rose  and
went gently in to her  it was quiet in the dimly lighted chamber  the
invalid lay softly sleeping  her face all bandaged  and her glorious
hair a mass of gold about the pillow  under her hand was an open letter
tempted by the influence of her dream  christobel drew nearer  it was
prince olivin s firm writing  there were only a few lines  and the
moonlight shone full upon them  she could not help reading

beloved  think not to release me  it is your sweet nature i
love  you  your beautiful mind  nothing could ever change them
olivin

was it joy for her sister  was it some gleam of an unknown sense of
peace  tenderness  and hope in her soul  that brought scalding tears to
christobel s eyes as  half blinded by them  she groped her way back to
her room  where she fell on her knees and cried softly  and prayed that
now through her tears her eyes had been opened  she might learn to
become different   beauty is  not  everything  then   she repeated
wonderingly to herself over and over again  finding each time fresh
comfort in the thought   how wrong i have been  out of her disfigurement
veronica says my love for her has grown  and is worth much to her in
comfort  it has brought us close together  and made us both happy  how
grateful she is for every one s attention  and now the prince still
pleads for her  so  it was not her beauty that attracted him  it was not
her beauty  not her beauty   thus she thought earnestly and long  and it
brought her a strange sense of faith in herself and others   i shall
tell them all that i  too  know how truly she deserves her happiness

and tell them she did  and they opened their eyes and bowed
respectfully  and thought more of princess christobel than they had ever
thought before

new year s eve came round with its accustomed regularity  and the
inmates of cosmopolis castle were looking unusually grave for the
occasion  princess veronica was to appear once more in their midst  and
with the bandages removed from her poor face  it was a silent  uneasy
company that had gathered together in the great ball room  and king
jorum  engaged in a game of  snap  with little love in a corner  looked
ill and worn from anxiety for his favourite child

suddenly the card players rose  and a thrill of excitement went through
the assembly  princess veronica stood on the threshold in white muslin
and blue  her face showed no trace of scars  but her nose  her nose was
unrecognisable  it was no more aquiline  but tip tilted  the sweetest
little turned up feature imaginable  and her appearance had actually
gained   princess veronica had become the loveliest lady in the land

after being locked in her father s arms veronica found herself suddenly
in those of her lover  king jorum was frantic with delight  he called
for doctor quick and made him lord high druggist of his majesty s
dominions  with all the appanages  endowments  privileges  and
perquisites appertaining to the office  he showered honours on every
physician on or near the premises  he talked of bonfires  and of
honours  and tiaras all round  until he was hoarse  then princess
christobel appeared in white muslin and red ribbons  and there were
cheers for her animated appearance and her kind expression as she
gracefully returned their greeting   father   she said  drawing him on
one side   veronica is asking for countess spinx  may i  may i tell the
prisoner that now all is well she is forgiven   king jorum shook his
head vigorously  although he was too happy to do anything but smile all
the time   she has been in the cells for ever so long   pleaded
christobel  and her father was so taken aback at the revelation of her
fine eyes and sweet voice  which had never at any time struck him
before  that he nodded his head violently

that evening a stranger was bidden to the feast  no less a person than
the great traveller  brother to prince olivin  just returned from a
voyage of discovery  the bronzed and manly young duke of rosenleaf   who
is that charming young girl   he asked  as soon as he set eyes on her

princess christobel  your highness   replied little love with a sly
smile

king jorum couldn t get to sleep that night  he usually slept too much
and was in the habit of unscrewing the top of his foot warmer and
pouring therefrom the hot coffee which he imbibed at intervals in order
not to oversleep himself in the morning and thus set a bad example in
the land  but he had no need for it to night  he could not get to sleep
at all

he thought  and thought  and thought what had wrought such a marvellous
and rapid change in the character and appearance of his elder daughter
he smiled over it  too  and smiled until his cheeks ached with so much
smiling  as much as his poor head ached with so much thought  still he
went on thinking right through the night  and just as he put up his
arms above his head to break into a mighty yawn  he suddenly cried

i have it  that s it  she has realised the old theme of peace and
goodwill  as is proper at this time of year  and has turned over a new
leaf  bravo   and he turned himself over  snored  and overslept himself

so the first day of the new year opened in complete harmony at the court
of king jorum  and when the duke of rosenleaf asked princess christobel
if she would make the happy new year a happy one for him  she smiled and
blushingly allowed him to place the prettiest of diamond rings on her
finger

and the new year was still in its youth when the two young princesses
were married  and by the time that the shah of persia s
great great grand kittens were gambolling about the palace  it had
become a frequent and pleasant subject for argument and debate
throughout the kingdom   who is the most charming and lovable woman in
the land  christobel or veronica




one april day

part i

a queer godmother


it was the first of april  the weather could not make up its mind
whether to be tearful or gay  so  after changing three times  and
deciding at last that it was not grown up to cry  the sun dried up the
tear drops and beamed down on everything and everybody

isn t it a shame  wilfrid  to have to prepare lessons when it s such a
fine afternoon   exclaimed norah  she rose from the study table and
looked longingly out of the french window to where the crocuses on the
lawn seemed to be having the best of it

don t be lazy   replied her brother   just come and help me with this
sum when i tell you

i m not going to do as you tell me  if you were grown up  say
fifteen  it would be different  but you re only a year older than
me  not even nine yet  and yet you

halloa   interrupted wilfrid with a low whistle  as he strolled
towards the window   look at that s legs

which s   inquired norah  gazing in the direction he pointed

them s

what s   she asked eagerly  looking around

none  well  you  are  an april fool   exclaimed wilfrid with scornful
glee as he resumed his seat   that s the second time to day

and you re a very rude boy  and you re not allowed to call me horrid
names like that   said norah with dignity   and i won t be teased
always

with a very offended look  she set to work on her copy book

lend me your paint box when we ve finished our lessons  will you  norah
dear   said wilfrid  after a short pause

i can t   she replied  without looking up

why

i don t know why  but i can t

cat in the manger  you ve got nothing you want to paint  as i have

there was a longer pause  during which they both scribbled away  and
scratched  and spluttered  whilst their tongues moved silently from side
to side outside their parted lips  left to right  following the
direction of each new line

then norah heaved a sigh and remarked

wilfrid  isn t cinderella lovely

yes  as girls go

oh  how i wish we lived in those times  when there were fairy
godmothers and things   exclaimed norah rapturously  then she added with
a sigh

aunt leonora is my godmother  but she never gives me anything  and the
godmothers in the fairy stories always give heaps of things

you can t expect great fat podges like that to be like fairy
godmothers  you silly

but she ought to like giving things  how nice it is to give presents
and be thanked

yes  it s nice to give presents  when they are cheap  perhaps
continued her brother in a wise voice    perhaps aunt leonora can t
afford it if she isn t rich

cinderella s godmother never seemed to consider the price of anything
i wish  oh  how i wish

oh  how i wish you d be quiet and help me with this sum  you remember
your tables better than i do  but you needn t be jolly cocky about it
all the same

norah wasn t listening to him  her mind was far away from lessons  she
was thinking  if she had her choice  what she would like to be  what she
would like to do  and eat  and  above all  what she would like to wear
if only i had a fairy godmother  i

rubbish   exclaimed wilfrid  growing cross  and frowning as he watched
her moving restlessly about the room

i  of course  i wouldn t refuse her anything  fairy godmothers
generally appear at first disguised as old women  and ask for something
such as a drink of water  or beg you to carry a load of wood or whatever
they happen to have in hand  so i should be ready to do anything and
give anything  and earn my big reward

oh  shurrup   growled her brother   much better lend me your
paint box

but she didn t hear him  taken up with her fancies she continued
excitedly

i know what i ll do  i ll try and tempt her to come  perhaps i may even
have a fairy godmother without knowing it

and she began to dance about  singing

tra la la  fairy godmother
come to me now  i pray
visit a little girl who is longing for you
and will do anything you want
tra la la  fairy godmother  come

it wasn t very good poetry  but norah hadn t time to polish it up

oh  i say  how can i do my lessons with all this going on   exclaimed
wilfrid  and flinging his things together he bounced out of the room and
banged the door behind him

norah wasn t sorry he was gone  and danced once more all round the room
singing  then knelt down  and  stretching out her arms towards the
crocuses which were so stiff and upright in their indifference  she said
plaintively

come  dear fairy godmother  i want you

and lo  between norah and the window there suddenly appeared a little
old woman in a long cloak  whose features were hidden by the large hood
she wore

oh   exclaimed norah  almost breathless in her astonishment and
delight

i have come   said the stranger in cracked  quavering tones

i m so glad to see you   replied norah politely  too excited to feel
shy

i  your fairy godmother  am here to test you and see if you are really
worthy  see this slate which i have brought under my cloak  every little
lady should be able to do arithmetic right  can you do this sum

how funny  godmother dear   said norah  looking at it   we are just
learning these  it s a difficult one  but i ll try

in a few moments she had done the sum and proved it correct

very good   said the fairy  with a grunt of satisfaction

will you take a drink of water   now asked the hospitable norah
eagerly   do

no  thank you  but i may take something else  tell me  what of all your
treasures do you like most

oh  my paint box

i knew it  i am glad you tell the truth

how did you know it   asked norah in surprise

i am your fairy godmother  i ll take that paint box  please

norah brought it and gave it to her with the greatest pleasure  and
pressingly inquired if she might carry anything anywhere  but that was
not required  then she stood waiting expectantly  and her heart seemed
to turn a somersault of delight when her fairy godmother spoke the
following words

i am satisfied  now you may wish for whatever you like  but you must
make up your mind before i count three

norah s eyes had followed her glance at the clock  which pointed to one
minute to three  but her mind  from the flutter of excitement she was
in  became a complete blank

one   said the fairy solemnly

this brought the little goddaughter to her senses  and she began to
mutter confusedly

shall i wish for a gold carriage  like cinderella s  or a pet lamb
with a blue ribbon and a bell round its neck  or a frock embroidered in
diamonds  or

two   said the fairy

no   murmured norah hurriedly   if i were a queen  i could order those
things and everything else  i wish   the clock struck three   i were
a

three   called out the fairy

a queen   screamed norah  just the second after

too late   said the fairy   farewell   and she moved towards the door

norah s eyes filled with tears   please come back   she pleaded

i can t

oh  why can t you

i don t know why  but i can t   replied the little old woman

this sounded strangely in norah s ears  and what sounded stranger still
were the next words she heard uttered  these were simply

thanks  awfully

then norah exclaimed at once   that s wilfrid s voice   she pushed aside
the hood   why  you re wilfrid   she cried  amazed

and you re april billy   he shouted with glee  throwing off the long
cloak   you said you d do anything and give anything for a reward  and
now you ve had to do so without one   and  bursting out laughing  he ran
off with the sum and the paint box

norah sat down on a footstool and burst out crying  she was angry and
disappointed  and she sobbed bitterly as she thought how she had been
tricked into doing wilfrid s horrid sum  how she had been made to give
away her treasured paint box which he had envied for months  and  worst
of all a thousand times  how she had no fairy godmother after all


part ii

the little flower girl

but norah was a plucky little girl  and at times a wise little girl
and  moreover  she had a sort of feeling that it all served her right
for being silly  and dissatisfied  and too selfish to lend her
paint box  wilfrid certainly was a tease  but he was really a dear good
brother  and always lent her his things  and did his best to champion
her and get her out of a scrape

still  she felt she would like to pay him out  all the same  he d had
such a lovely time being fairy godmother

so she decided  like the weather  that it was not grown up to cry  and
she dried her eyes  then all at once she smiled and laughed outright
for an idea had come to her  which she proceeded to carry out  she
certainly began to do some rather queer things

first of all she took off her shoes and stockings  then she untied the
pink ribbon which kept her hair tidy  so that her curls fell in a
towsled mass about her flushed cheeks  next she took off her pink
overall pinafore  which she hid away  and gathering her white frock over
her head  displayed a short red and white striped petticoat

running quickly about the room she took all the violets from the vases
strewed some of them in the fold of her frock  which she held together
in one hand  and put together a large bunch of the flowers for her other
hand

then she stepped through the open window  threw some sand upon her feet
and ankles  and thus prepared  stood on the path outside  looked in  and
waited

very soon wilfrid burst into the room  exclaiming

come and look at the healthy colour i ve painted on your big doll s
pale cheeks  oh  norah   he added  looking round the empty room

and now he became conscious of a little flower girl standing on the
garden path  and piteously offering him a bunch of violets

norah had heard what he had said  and felt vexed that he had dared to
touch her big doll  still  she had not the affection for that stately
lady that she had for the small invalid doll with the broken leg  so she
only said

buy a bunch of violets  sir

he was a tender hearted boy  and at once fetched down his money box from
a shelf in the cupboard  unlocked it  and took out twopence which he
gave her  but then he felt awkward and refused the flowers

an organ in the street started playing

i can dance to that if you can pay   said the little girl thoughtfully
eyeing the money box

how much do you want   he asked

three shillings   she replied boldly

that s all i ve got

that ll do  then   she said   i want it so badly

yes  but

not heeding his protests  she stole into the room and began to dance to
the organ  as she had seen the poor children do in the streets  her
little bare feet twirling up slowly and descending with measured steps
on to the soft carpet

oh  i say   soon exclaimed wilfrid with dissatisfaction   my sister
norah can dance better than that  for nothing

nevertheless  he felt bound to empty his money box into the hand she now
held out

solemnly she made him a little bob of a curtsey  then she began to caper
about the room in a very different sort of spirit  and then  catching
hold of the astonished boy round the neck  she kissed him

hi  shurrup   cried wilfrid  disengaging himself and looking sheepish

oh  you april goose   sang norah   april goose  you re an april goose
master wilfrid   and she uncovered her head and shook back her curls

halloa   exclaimed wilfrid  ruefully at first  and then added more
cheerily

ha  do you think i didn t know you all the time

did you really   inquired his sister  her eyes wide open with surprise

no  i didn t   he replied curtly

then norah s arm stole round her brother s neck  and she put the money
into his pocket  and told him gently that she had only wanted to have a
little bit of fun  and he was welcome to use her paint box  only please
not on her dolls

then wilfrid told her that she was a jolly good sort  and that after
all it was a shame to tease her  as she couldn t fight him for it  and
norah hugged him  and they both laughed about how well they had
pretended  to one another

the sun was shining still  and when the children romped on the lawn the
stuck up crocuses didn t have the best of it  after all




the storm the teapot brewed


in a bright nursery  hung with pictures  the table was laid for tea
upon an iron tray  which had seen much service  even military service
as a drum used by the nursery band  stood the tea set  this set included
a very large cup which belonged to nurse  bearing the funny inscription
i am not greedy  but i like a lot   the other cups were also lettered
in gold  one hailed  it declared   from margate   and showed the pier as
a proof  another  a small one made of porcelain  wished  many happy
returns to effie  every time she looked at it  a thick  fat cup
proclaimed itself  a present to daniel   and a mug bore the perpetual
reminder that it was  for a good boy   but it was cracked  so it didn t
look quite happy  perhaps because the reminder was not always capable of
keeping the boy good

the kettle completed the party  but sat comfortably on the warm hob next
the fire  drowsily singing snatches of song  in the knowledge of having
done his duty in giving the thirsty teapot a drink of water  so all was
ready for tea except the children  nurse had gone to collect them  when
the chinese teapot  who always liked to appear important  suddenly
exclaimed

what a noise that kettle is making  to be sure  one could scarcely hear
one s self rattle if one wanted to

the kettle  ignoring the protest  sang on

just now we were quiet
no noise and no riot
you could hear a bread plate drop  flop

we used to have a very nice english teapot once   remarked the
porcelain cup

i remember   replied her neighbour from margate   he came from
worcestershire  he was a big pot  and thought himself no end of a
swell

what  kettle time already   exclaimed the tongs  yawning and stretching
his legs

a nice sort of life it is for one of my grade and standing   grumbled
the teapot   to be surrounded by such a set of ugly  foreign mugs and
things as you all are

there was a general rattling of displeasure at the insult  but it was
drowned by the kettle  who could see a joke  singing up merrily

if there s a fuss  if a pot should allude
as a  mug  to a china cup
there s always a clatter
of jug  plate  and platter
till somebody washes them up

it s disgraceful to go on like this   complained the milk jug  looking
rather broken down about the handle

ah   said the teapot with a sneer   when one only dates from 1887  and
hasn t a handle to one s back  one should retire to the seclusion of the
cupboard  and remain there as a curio

there was once a jubilee jug gins
jug jug juggins

hummed the kettle

poor old crock   said the sugar basin sweetly  melting with pity
through all her composition  for she was his inseparable companion  and
knew that the milk jug was full of human kindness  and useful still

never mind the quarrelling  darlings   whispered the gentlemanly spoons
to their lady friends  whom they had taken in to tea   we will protect
you

upon my word   exclaimed she from margate   i m glad  i  was not born
in china  where i come from rudeness is unknown

the kettle took up the idea and sang gaily

they re pottery  porcelain  colour  and gold
they come from the china shop
where crockery s bought  and the customer s sold
and the bull galloped in so angry and bold
and when the poor  terrified shopkeeper told
him to go  he did nothing but stop

you ought to have a will of iron if you re made of the right stuff
she continued  addressing the tray   you ought to keep order  but you
say nothing and do less

you see  he s only a waiter  slow and unpolished   added the teapot
spitefully

my view  if i may express it    broke in the cup from margate

when i want your view  either of margate or of politeness   retorted
the tray  interrupting the remark   i ll ask for it  if i d the chance
i d drop the whole lot of you  and get friendly with a new set  that i
would

whereupon the irrepressible kettle chirruped

then he d pay the expense of the mender s bill
the mender is doctor  you see
who makes out an order
a matter of sawder
and rivets  cement  and a fee

you re always brewing mischief   said nurse s cup angrily to the
teapot   there ll be no peace for any of us where you are

that s true   screamed out the little tea leaves inside the pot   he s
always getting us into hot water

i ll draw the tannin out of the whole ounce of you  you re about as
sensible as mortals who haven t the wit to understand us  but when we
go cracked like muggins over there  or stony broke like the juggins
next to him  or get smashed up altogether with age or lack of care  they
take notice of us at last  and then there is a mighty fine fuss

at this the kettle  getting somewhat out of breath from his exertions
bubbled out in a high key

they re wedgwood  staffordshire  japanese too
they re a breakable lot  we know
when any one cracks any
chelsea or saxony
dresden  or worcester  or bow
they make as much shindy
as if a big windy
was shivered to bits by a blow

the teapot went on   those people are amusing  too  they think we ought
to last for ever  when they can t do it themselves

a couple of chatterpots   exclaimed the nurse s cup   dear me  what
with your spouting  and his showing off once he begins to sing  you re
enough to wear one out

dear  you  indeed   returned the teapot    cheap  you  why  you were
given away with a pound of tea  shouldn t be surprised at all   he
continued  watching nurse s cup become speechless with indignation
but  spouting aside  i could tell you a thing or two

or three  or four  or five  or    the kettle might have sung on into
billions had he not begun to choke over it  and splutter  and gurgle
then he grew vexed  and snorted  and got angrier and angrier  until
finally  in order to breathe more easily  he knocked his lid on one
side  and began to boil with rage

ha  ha   laughed the teapot mockingly   the old fellow s getting his
steam up  pray don t de range yourself  sir  on our account  he  he
he s getting water on his nob

this didn t seem to comfort the kettle much

what do you think about it  spoonies   added the teapot  but the spoons
heeded him not  they were conversing quietly in couples  and didn t care
to be drawn into argument  so he turned his attention elsewhere  bent on
brewing discord   people are so thoughtless   he complained  turning a
cold shoulder to the others   muggins  my boy  i m beginning to get
quite chilly  just go and fetch my cosy coat   he knew this was an
impossibility  and he only said it in order to pick a quarrel  but
noticing a distant plate who was openly laughing at him  he cuttingly
remarked   seen the plumber  lately   now  the plate happened to be
suffering severely from rivets  an infirmity which she vainly tried to
hide  and which she hated to be noticed  so  getting no reply  he
added   i presume that your plumbago is better

the kettle was now puffing and spitting to such a degree that it was
difficult to imagine he was the same jolly fellow who had been singing
so good temperedly all the time

and the teapot was content  he had gained his object  and the whole set
felt as though they had been wiped the wrong way  when suddenly noisy
voices were heard outside

the nursery door was opened  and in burst fred  home from margate
school  followed by gentle little effie  and nurse  vigorously
protesting at being pushed forward in jerks by bob  poor  long suffering
nurse  as usual  was not having at all a good time with the three
troublesome boys  daniel had clambered on her back  and was trying to
pull off her cap  bob  who was not nearly such  a good boy  as his mug
pretended  slily untied her apron strings  the apron dropped  and nurse
tripped over it  jerking daniel on to the floor  and she would have
fallen too had she not just saved herself by clutching the table

cr cr crikey   clattered the china on the tray in alarm

bless those boys   cried nurse  as she replaced her apron  but they
only laughed  effie was helping to put her cap straight when the
kettle  unable to contain his feelings any longer  marked his
indignation by hissing disapproval and then boiling over  nurse rushed
to his aid  and altered his position so that he couldn t see all that
went on  he recovered himself at once

bustling into their chairs  they all sat down to tea  and at the sudden
action the whole tea set rattled to arms  some standing at attention
the spoons  stirred by the children s hands  began knocking the sides of
the cups  dealing them blows right and left  and ringing out their
resounding protests

here s a  stranger    exclaimed effie  taking a tea leaf out of her
cup   who will it be

a horrid foreigner  miss  a little black indian   replied the teapot
turning up his spout with scorn  and giving a vicious squeeze to the
others he held prisoners

i know who it is   said bob  tilting back his chair  then suddenly
steadying himself by grasping the table  this was a troublesome habit of
his  which drew nurse s usual reminder

what s his name   asked the others eagerly

i  know  it s a secret   replied bob mysteriously

at this a loud argument began

my lid  who s making the noise now   the teapot cried   pray don t
upset your precious selves

i think it must be mr  manners who is the stranger   exclaimed nurse
putting her hands to her ears to shut out the tumult

no   shouted bob   i ll tell you  his name s mr  tea leaf   and he
laughed triumphantly

as the other children raised their voices to declare it was very unfair
bob swung back on his chair again

oh   screamed nurse in a fright  making a grab at the table  but she
was too late

bob had already made a grab at it when  with a  swish  bang   he tumbled
over backwards  dragging the cloth with him  and everything upon it  and
the crockery lay around  all broken to atoms

in the moment of hushed alarm that followed  the tray rolled away
exclaiming in triumph   i ve got rid of them at last  i said i would
when i got the chance   and the kettle  gazing at the wreckage  sang on
serenely and merrily

there s been such a fuss  such a storm has been brewed
there s no cups for the tea  and no plates for the food
the cleverest doctor may puzzle his wits
but he never can gather and rivet the bits




monica the moon child

i

this side of the moon


it was one of those late afternoons in winter when the countryside looks
very white  very still  and hushed to sleep under its coverlet of
snow  just the time when the bright fire at home is thought of with
delightful longing  the gentleman who drove the phaeton that was bowling
along the frosty road must have thought so too  for he cracked his whip
so smartly that it sounded loud in the silent landscape  startling the
cob to a more hurried remembrance of his snug stable

not very far now  doctor   he remarked to the friend who sat next to
him   home soon  toodleums   he added  turning towards a big bundle of
shawls at the back of the carriage

i m in no hurry  papa   replied a childish voice   i call this lovely

quite warm  eh

quite  thank you  papa

the bundle  answering to the name of toodleums  was monica  her father s
constant companion  she was an only child  her mother had always been
delicate  and monica was not allowed to be much with her  she even
forgot that the invalid at home was ailing rather more than usual
to day  and that their long drive was to fetch her old friend the doctor
for his opinion  for she was listening with so much interest to an
explanation which her father was giving of the new airship he had
invented  he was still describing his successful trial trip  when monica
noticed that the moon and stars seemed to have assembled all at once to
make a night of it  never before had she driven out after dark  and soon
she became all absorbed  in a state of muffled up rapture  at the
unusual sights and aspect of mystery about

hi  toodleums  do you hear  what do you say to going up with me in my
airship next time i go  will you come

yes  yes   she answered eagerly   i ll come  papa

you re not afraid of bumping up against the moon   asked the doctor
playfully  leaning over to pat her cheek  and both gentlemen laughed
monica didn t answer  she didn t know if she was being made fun of or
not

at last they were in the hall at home  amidst the lights and bustling of
the servants  as no one seemed to notice her  monica took herself up to
the nursery  she had dressed there near the fire  and the boxes and
things had not been tidied away  monica stared around  thinking this
very unusual  and was just beginning to feel uncomfortably lonely when a
little wrinkled old woman with very bright eyes hurriedly trotted in

oh  grandnurse   exclaimed monica   no one is looking after me  how s
mamma

much better  dearie  but i m wanted downstairs  can you spare me
poppets  put yourself to bed  and i ll be back directly with your hot
milk   without waiting for an answer she bustled into the adjoining
night nursery  where monica heard her busily opening and shutting the
great cupboards

the cheery old body was called grandnurse because she had been in the
family for ever so long  so long as to have become  as it were  a member
of it  passing through the nursery again she stopped and said

what would my poppets say to a little sister  i wonder  a tiny new
baby

oh  grandnurse   and before the old woman could hurry out of the door
monica sprang forward  her face all aglow with excitement  and holding
her tight by the arm cried all in a breath

is it true  where is it  when s it coming  who s going to bring it

patience  i can t wait now  let me go  dearie   said grandnurse
disengaging herself from the little girl

but is it true

quite true

what will it come in

a bandbox  of course   answered grandnurse  laughing gaily as she went
out of the room

can i fetch it  when can i fetch it   persisted monica  following her
downstairs

when there s a blue moon  now go back  there s a dear

yes  but who s going to bring it

don t ask me  ask the man in the moon   said the little old woman over
her shoulder in a hushed voice as she disappeared down a dark passage of
the large house

monica  standing there  laughed a little scornful laugh   ask the man
in the moon  indeed   she muttered   as though there were one  she often
says that  but i m not so silly as to believe it   and full of thought
of the new little sister she re entered the nursery

the heavy curtains had not been drawn  and the moon was looking at her
just as it had done during the drive  how lovely it was  that drive  she
went to the large window seat and curled herself up in her favourite
corner  outside it looked so cold and white that she drew the curtain
close around her with a little shiver

can grandnurse really think there is a man in the moon   pondered
monica as she gazed up at it  and confusedly she thought on   i wonder
if there is  after all  can he be going to bring the baby  i should so
like to know  and when  or who is going to  i wish he d tell me  perhaps
if i were to ask  who spoke about bumping up against the moon  ah

monica had conceived a grand idea  quietly she stole to the table
snatched up the empty hatbox which ought to have been tidied away  and
then  and then she crept stealthily downstairs  everything was
quiet  stealthily out into the night she went  now she was in the great
shed  where the airship was  quite an old friend  she had seen her
father start on his journey in it  and had heard it all explained  the
precious bandbox was placed in the car  and the next moment monica was
beside it  she touched a button  the great structure moved  she held her
breath  and her heart thumped surprisingly  then she clapped her hands
with delight  the airship slowly moved forward out of the shed  and when
she pulled a lever thing  close at hand  she was soaring like a bird
right out into the night  soaring right up towards the heavens  she was
going to ask the man in the moon to be kind enough to give her the new
baby she had come to fetch

illustration  she was soaring like a bird right out into the night

how cold and crisp the air was  monica was glad to have on her coat and
cap of fur  higher  higher she went until she lost consciousness of
everything except the cold and a sense of loneliness

and the airship rose upwards  upwards  carrying its pretty burden with
eyes fast closed  and the curly brown head lay helplessly low  supported
by the staring white empty bandbox



bump  there was a crunching noise as of carriage wheels on a gravel
path  the airship was aground on something  and monica realised she must
get her wits about her  she quickly pushed back the lever thing and the
noise ceased  the movement also

in the brilliant light  like sunlight  monica saw she had alighted on
some rocks  whilst round about was nothing but mountains  craters
caverns  and awful stillness  there was not a creature about  nor a sign
of anything living  it was dreary to a degree

wherever am i   exclaimed little monica  she scrambled out of the car
and slung the bandbox on her arm  somehow there was company in that
above her a moon was shining  not  the  moon she was accustomed to see
but one about four times larger  as though suffering from a swollen
face  with a pattern on it like the map of europe

illustration   round about was nothing but mountains  craters
caverns

that does look queer   she muttered aloud   bumped against the moon
she thought to herself unconsciously  for now she remembered her father
having told her what the earth must look like from there  and she
realised that she had reached her destination  and was actually walking
about in the moon  and that the larger moon was really the earth  this
fact was so exciting that she sat down to consider it  enjoy its
importance  and decide what to do

she determined to go on  and so she rose and went gaily forward  the
bandbox swinging from her arm  but it was very difficult walking  steep
and rocky

at last she found herself in a large plain of broken stones   much in
want of a steam roller   thought monica as she bravely hobbled
along  and all around were caves

out of the largest one of these there emerged a tall and majestic
figure  which  to her astonishment  slowly glided sideways towards her
wrapped in a cloudy drapery  then monica was convinced  and she no
longer had any doubt whatever but that there was a man in the moon  and
that this was he  so very slowly did he advance that she had plenty of
time to recover from her surprise  and went forward to meet him and
introduce herself

his steely blue eye had a peculiar cold beam in it as he said

i bid you unwelcome  are you not frightened

no   replied the child   why should i be  i ve done no harm

do you call coming here no harm   all the time he never stopped still a
second  but kept gloomily mooning about  his profile with its protruding
nose and chin in sharp outline always turned towards her

i ve come to  to fetch    stammered monica  chilled by her reception

you re a trespasser  you re evidently a poacher  too   he added
glancing angrily at the bandbox   begone

but  please sir  do tell me

with a warning gesture the man slowly raised his arm till its cloud like
drapery hid his face  and he disappeared

dear me  i don t like him a little bit   murmured monica  staring
vacantly about  and found that where he had stood there was a big board
on which in big letters was inscribed


trespassers will be moonstruck
by order


at the sight of it monica quickly took refuge in the smallest of the
caves

who are you   said a voice  and as soon as her eyes had become
accustomed to the gloom she saw a queer creature resembling a great toad
swathed in a long white beard

whoever you are   said the quaint inhabitant   i m too blind to see
you  just lead me to the further corner  there s a good trespasser

monica did not quite like being talked to like that  but she held out
the bandbox and  supporting himself by it  her new acquaintance limped
to where he was led and sat down

thanks  and many of them  it s not so draughty here   he said

have you been long in this cave   asked monica

a few thousand years or so  i can t tell to a minute   he mumbled   but
who are you  my dear  by birth  of course  a lunarian  but not by
accent

monica mentioned who she was  whereupon he became quite talkative  and
began telling her about the moon  but only what she had read in her
lesson books

have you a house of parliament   she asked  anxious to glean useful
information  she had recently been to hear her father speak in theirs
at home  and was very proud of that

we ve only a moonicipality  you know   said her strange companion
rambling on until he became quite drowsy  emboldened by his kind manner
she told him why she had come  and begged for his advice  to her dismay
the only reply she got was a series of the loudest snores she had ever
heard  he was sound asleep

do tell me what i had better do   she implored  and she shook and
pinched him till he awoke

get on the right side of him  and don t bother me   croaked the old
creature  and snored louder than ever  delighted at the hint  monica
came out on to the plain  and saw the man gliding slowly on  sideways
as before  he frowned heavily on seeing her there  and seemed speechless
with indignation

get on the right side of him   repeated monica to herself as she made a
dart forward to do so  this proved unsuccessful  for just then he turned
so blue that she stopped  wondering if he was getting a fit
grandnurse s words   when there s a blue moon   suddenly occurred to
her  and she knew that now was her chance  she took courage in his
slowness  and without looking at him a second time she rushed  stooping
low  into a very small cave on the other side of him


ii

the other side of the moon

it was not a cave at all  it was an arbour  the beams of which were
moonbeams  so that monica stepped straight through into it and sat down
upon a bench

evidently the moon is not made of green cheese  as grandnurse always
thought   pondered monica with the pride of the discoverer   i must
remember to tell her that   and she was just tying a knot in her
handkerchief to remind herself when she was startled to hear a musical
voice say

are you aware that you are on the wrong side of the moon   it belonged
to a tiny figure no bigger than monica s doll  dressed like a lady
gardener  with apron  straw hat  and big gloves

the little blind man in the cave told me it is the right side for me
replied monica politely

oh   he s never done so before  but if toady told you that  then no one
can blame the gardeness  who are you

i am monica

it s a strange name  some parents have queer fancies  you are the first
moon child who has ever come back  how you have grown  to be sure  i
shouldn t have known you   when she heard monica s errand and had
refreshed her memory as to where she lived  she remarked with surprise
we ve had an order for one to be sent to your address to day  we
always forward to customers  houses  but people  never  come and fetch
them  it s a most unheard of proceeding   added the little lady with a
toss of her pretty head   where s your check

illustration   a tiny figure  no bigger than monica s doll

cheque  have i got to buy it  i ve just spent all my money on a new
doll   said monica  her eyes filling with tears   and now i might have
bought the new baby instead

we re on the check system here   said the little lady  smiling   come
with me and i ll show you round  then you ll see what nonsense you re
talking

monica brightened up  and they proceeded down a trim gravel path that
had a moonstone wall on either side and a big door at the end

who are you  please   asked monica as they went along

where you come from  clever people call me selene  here  i am the
gardeness   your pass check   she added in a business like way   to
order or bearer  which do you want   the child hesitated   you want to
order a baby  i suppose   the gardeness was becoming rather impatient

oh yes  i ve come to fetch it

but you can t have a cheque to order and bearer at the same time

can t i   inquired monica plaintively   how can i take it  then

that will be my business   whispered her companion mysteriously  then
added loudly   the little ones are being checked in the counting house
now  be quick  or the pick of the choice will be gone

to order   faltered monica

whereupon her companion pushed the great door  which swung open  and the
quaint pair quickly passed through   they are always on order   remarked
the gardeness as she led monica up a high flight of steps   but we
forward them in our own way  excuse my question  it was a matter of
form

now they were in the loveliest garden ever seen  and monica gave a
little sob of delight as she noticed that all around about her in every
flower nestled the dearest  wee est little baby imaginable  whilst
hundreds of tiny creatures were tending them  drying the dew drops from
their big round eyes  and turning their little bald heads for more air
all the while humming a refrain which monica recognised as her mother s
favourite one  called the  bee s wedding

at first she marvelled silently at the beauty of the scene  then  as she
basked in the pervading warmth  she remembered having been surprised at
seeing the moon and sun out at the same time  and now realised the moon
was sunning its garden of babies

i ve brought my bandbox   she remarked  laughing gaily

that s a good thing   replied her companion   as it has to be a private
transaction  stoop down   and she drew monica closer to the rows upon
rows of the beautifullest roses  gently moved the petals of one of them
and revealed embedded in the heart of the rose its own sweet little
baby

illustration   rows upon rows of the beautifullest roses

then the gardeness told monica with infinite pride about the flower
infants under her care  to her visitor s remark on their resemblance to
each other  she replied touchily   i suppose you ve seen many girls
called rose  who were alike when born  but they differ enough later
it s the same with the rest

the gardeness pointed out to her the children with the names of lily
daisy  sweet william  and others  all borne up by their especial flower
her own flower  the gardenia  and the marigold s mary  and told her how
in some flowers the children imbibe their tastes from their
surroundings  thus  as they strolled around  monica heard that the
dandelion turns out too foppish a child  that amongst the wild oats the
harum scarum boys develop  that the blue cornflower babies remain true
to their liking for farinaceous food  and in love lies bleeding  little
cupids are born

monica went through the vegetable garden and saw the turnips  where the
noses of the infants looked so funny   they generally take a dislike to
vegetables later on   explained the gardeness   now those over there
pointing to a bed of 18 carrots   are as good as gold  but we must not
linger here  you shall have a peep at the orchard  and visit the
counting house  then you must be quick and make your choice

in the orchard were only boy babies  some sweet tempered  others sour
the gardeness wouldn t recommend a gooseberry one  for it was apt to
grow up silly  there were some rosy  apple cheeked ones  but they looked
all  cheek  little gipsy faced babies peeped with black eyes from out
of the blackberry bushes  whilst in the fruit and nut trees close by
were many pairs of hard headed little twins  all philips and
philippines

there s no time   observed the gardeness   to visit the indian garden
or the chinese  or the others  i should like to have shown you some
quaint little baby girls called peach blossom in the japanese garden
but after all  i suppose you prefer an english one  they are generally
chosen according to climate   and seeing monica smile and nod  she
hurried her off to the counting house

monica had not been considering at all what she should choose  for she
had lost her heart to that first little rose baby

very soon they reached their destination  a long  low building
listen   said the gardeness  drawing her to an open window   they are
actually quarrelling over it again   there was a fearful hubbub going on
inside  above which could be distinguished

if one times six is six  six times one must be one  so that fat infant
weighs more than one and six

ah   exclaimed her guide   a stupid wrangle  no wonder that complaints
arise  and that the children don t always arrive at their destinations
in time  it causes no end of bother  pass in   the noise ceased  and in
the enormous room hundreds of babies freshly gathered from the garden
were being numbered and ticketed by a regular little army of miniature
hospital nurses  who received instructions from their superiors standing
behind the counter  as she entered  monica heard that no  47 859 056  a
dear little indian baby  was to be forwarded to some strange sounding
address in calcutta  where it was expected in 27 days  7 hours  48
minutes  and 11 5 seconds  very business like  but it would have been
simpler to say that day next month  for it was a lunar month

as it was carried away  monica and her guide followed and entered the
packing and forwarding department  and saw it wrapped up in cabbage
leaves  packed in one of the numerous bandboxes which lined the walls
and gently warned that if it cried much it would crack its voice  then
the box was labelled  fragile  with care   and put down a trap door in
the floor  where it disappeared from view

the babies were being brought in rapidly  packed with all despatch  and
each received advice  such as  to sleep as much as it could after the
journey  when bored  to suck its thumb  to try and get its own way
whenever possible  and when it disapproved  to express the same in the
usual manner

immediately they got outside the gardeness advised monica  as her
parents were well to do  to choose a set of twins  which were not
welcome everywhere  and thus save them being planted on a poor family
for they had to be got off somehow  so were always sent  as if by
mistake  where least expected  but monica mentioned her choice  and
begged very hard for it  so the gardeness took the bandbox from her
bade her wait behind a tree  and with that little toss of the head went
to gather the rose baby which had been sent for in so unheard of a way
monica waited there so long that she became very anxious

at last the gardeness returned  pale and out of breath  hurriedly warned
her not to let in any cold air on to the child  which was packed all
snug and comfortable in the bandbox  and  above all  to make all speed
or she would meet some one she wouldn t like  showed her a short cut to
the boundary  kissed her hand  and was gone

monica  trembling all over with excitement  hastened away with her
precious burden  the difference in weight being scarcely perceptible
she ran quickly towards the spot where she had left the airship  quickly
placed her treasure and herself inside  and had just touched the  drop
spring  when the man in the moon appeared  approaching slowly  his face
was turned fully towards her  and looked quite different from what it
had been before  calm and expressionless  but she did not trust it  and
was thankful when she pushed off and felt the airship was moving away
feeling safe at last  monica smiled in triumph  with one hand she raised
her bandbox on high  with the other she waved a farewell  then the man
as if in protest  lifted his arm so that his face once more was hidden
in gloom

and monica felt herself dropping  dropping rapidly into the blackness of
the icy cold night



she was thinking   my book says that no one on earth has ever seen the
other side of the moon  so no one knows what on earth is on the other
side of it  that s why grandnurse couldn t answer my questions
properly  and the man wouldn t  perhaps even he has never seen the
garden of babies  as he was far too tall to enter that small cave  how
lucky i found it all out for myself    when  with a great start she came
to earth and confusedly recognised the lighted windows of her home  how
she got the airship back into its shed and how she entered the nursery
window she never quite remembered  throwing back the heavy curtain from
the window seat  without noticing grandnurse  who was in the room
monica took off her coat and cap  hurriedly placed them in the
night nursery  ran back  and peeped eagerly under the lid of the bandbox
on the table  it was empty    goodness gracious me  missie   cried
grandnurse   not put yourself to bed yet

illustration   the man lifted his arm so that his face was once more
hidden in gloom

oh  grandnurse  what  have  you done with the new baby   asked monica
piteously  great tears brimming over her eyes

they must always be unpacked at once  you know  without a moment s
delay  come and see  my poppets  for i m sure you won t rest without
added the kind old woman  leading her away

and there  in a dressing room  in a bassinette  already cosily asleep
but still sucking its thumb  monica beheld with rapture the tiny rose
baby she had chosen in that lovely garden high up in the moon  in
cloudland far away

section 4   information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment   many small donations
1 to  5 000  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states   compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort  much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements   we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance   to
send donations or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http   pglaf org

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements  we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

international donations are gratefully accepted  but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states   u s  laws alone swamp our small staff

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses   donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks  online payments and credit card
donations   to donate  please visit  http   pglaf org donate
